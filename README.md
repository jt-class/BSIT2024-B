## First Chapter
Shin Tachibana is a high school student who left Sado Island years ago, hoping for the city's excitement, bright lights, and endless possibilities. But when he received news of Nami's death, something pulled him back. He couldn’t understand it—a sense of duty, maybe—or the gnawing guilt that he had left behind those he cared about most. Nami  is a high school student who has been his best friend, the girl who dared him to explore the darkest caves, who laughed with him under the summer stars, and who has been there for him when no one else was.

Shin woke up on a boat, where his eyes wandered around, and he checked his phone. He saw his childhood friend Nami on the boat. Nami’s dressed in a plain white summer dress. 

**A QUIET STREET - DAY**

Shin (shouting): Hey! What are you doing here?

Nami: Hey Shin, close your eyes for a sec.

Shin: Wha– what are you doing?

Nami gently covers his eyes with her hand. Shin’s vision becomes blurry.

Nami (softly): There you go.

She removes her hand from his eyes. Shin blinks and looks at her, puzzled.

Shin: What’s this?

Nami: It’s a gift.

A moment of silence. Nami's smile fades as her expression softens. She asks suddenly.

Nami: How are you? How many years has it been since you've been home?

Shin (scratching his head): Uhhh, I guess... It's been three years?

Nami (surprised): Heeh?! You didn’t even come back during the New Year either…

Nami's voice takes on a sad tone.

Shin (feeling guilty): Uhh, I'm sorry…

Nami (cheerfully, changing the topic): Anyways, give my regards when you go home... and don't forget to find me.

Shin (confused): Huh, I don’t get it…

Nami (gently, smiling): Also... please protect Emi. *disappeared*

Shin is shocked at why he's falling and shouting Nami's name. After that, Shin woke up while shouting Nami's name. The mysterious girl next to him was shocked to hear his voice. 

After that, the ship arrived on Sado Island. When they got off the ship, Emi saw Shin wearing a white T-shirt, blue jeans, and running shoes. Emi was excited to approach him. She was so excited that she ran to hug Shin; she did not realize that there was a car coming towards her. Luckily, the driver saw her immediately to avoid hitting her. 

STREET - DAY

Emi (with a sigh of relief): Whew, that was close, huh?

Shin (looking concerned, staring at her blue school uniform): Hey, Emi, are you okay? Has anything hurt?

The camera lingers on Emi, her blue uniform standing out. She's Nami's younger sister, still in high school.

Emi (smiling, cheerful): Oh, no, I’m alright. Thank you for worrying.

They continue walking in the direction of Emi's house. The mood becomes lighter as they talk.

Emi: It’s been a long time since I saw you, though.

Shin nods as they reach Emi's house, where she's about to change for a funeral.

They arrived at the funeral.


The small coastal town of Sado, bathed in the warm, golden light of summer, feels eerily quiet, as if holding its breath. Shin can’t shake the feeling that something is off; Nami's death doesn’t seem natural. His mind races as he recalls the mysterious shadows he saw in the days leading up to the tragedy. As he glances at the sorrowful faces around him, a chilling realization dawns: the events of this summer are far from ordinary, and the answers may be more terrifying than he could ever imagine. The island's secrets are beginning to unravel, and Shin is about to find himself caught in a deadly cycle where reality and illusion blur and the past refuses to stay buried. 

After they arrive at the funeral, Shin gives his sympathy to Nami’s family. He feels a deep sense of unease as he observes the mourners. Shin dreamt about his past 10 years ago, when his parents died and the family of Nami’s took him. So he didn’t just think of Nami as just a friend but also his closest family.

REN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Shin (softly, hesitant): I’m sorry for your loss. Nami was... she was like a sister to me.

Ren (wiping his tears, his voice breaking): Thank you, Shin. She always spoke fondly of you. It’s just... I still can’t believe she’s gone.

Shin (pauses, then carefully asks): I've been thinking about what happened. Do you think there was anything unusual before...?

Ren (confused): Unusual? No, she was her usual self. But, Shin, why would you ask that?

Shin (glancing around, lowering his voice): I don’t know. It’s just this feeling I have. Like there’s something we’re missing, something we’re not seeing.

Ren (nervously): What do you mean, Shin? This was just a tragic accident, right?

Shin (somber, unsure): I hope so. But... I can’t shake the feeling that something’s wrong on this island. Something is not natural.

Ren (fear creeping in): Shin, what are you saying?

Shin: I don’t know yet, but I’m going to find out. I owe it to Nami to uncover the truth.

Ren wipes his eyes again and walks over to speak with other visitors, leaving Shin alone with his thoughts. The sounds of murmurs from the crowd fill the room.

Unknown Person 1 (whispering): Is that Shin?

Unknown Person 2: Ah, yes. He must be the one who’s suffering because he lost his best friend.

Unknown Person 1: But hey, didn’t you know they did an autopsy on Nami’s body? The results say it was just an accident.

Unknown Person 2: Aw, that’s sad to hear.

Shin glances out the window, lost in thought. Suddenly, he feels arms wrap around his back. He turns to see his friend, Kenji, who is also in high school, dressed in a white polo and black slacks, tears in his eyes.

Kenji (sobbing, emotional): Shin! It’s been a long time; where have you been?!

Shin (managing a small smile): Kenji! You really dressed up for this, huh?

Shin glances at Kenji’s white polo and black slacks.

Kenji (shrugging somberly): Yeah, I figured it’s the least I could do for Nami. She deserves our respect, you know?

Shin (nodding, his expression darkening): Yeah, she did. It’s just... hard to wrap my head around all this.

Kenji (confused): Are you okay, Shin? You seem off. More than usual.

Shin (sighs, looking out the window again): I’m just trying to make sense of everything. Something doesn’t feel right about all this.

Kenji (placing a reassuring hand on Shin’s shoulder): Hey, whatever it is, we’ll figure it out together. Nami was our friend too.

While Shin and Kenji were talking, suddenly a camera flashed, and they saw Lekra. Shin noticed the flash coming from behind, so he looked and observed if someone was taking a picture. But there’s no one holding a camera. He noticed the little boy staring at him.

**FUNERAL HALL - DAY**

Shin stands in the corner of the room, staring blankly at the crowd. A sudden flash crosses his mind.

Shin (thinking to himself): What was that flash?

His eyes shift towards a young boy standing in the distance.

Shin (whispering to Kenji): Who is that young boy?

Kenji (whispering back): Ahh, that’s Lekra. His family owns the small convenience store on the island. He’s the child Nami rescued in the sea.

Kenji leans in closer, his voice lower.

Kenji: My dad and the police did an autopsy on Nami’s body... and there’s a suspicious mark on her neck.

Shin (shocked): What?! Does anyone know about it?

Kenji (in a hushed tone):Only you, the police, my father, and me. The police ruled it as an accident because no one was around when Nami saved the drowning kid.

Shin (stunned): What...?

Kenji: Let’s talk about it later. I’ll call you.

The conversation is cut short as the funeral continues with cultural rituals. The priest stands near the coffin, preparing for the next part of the ceremony.

Fuji (approaching Shin): Shin, can you help us lift the coffin?

Shin (nodding): Sure, I’m coming.

*They put the coffin in the back of the car that will deliver the body.

REN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Later that evening, Shin is in the kitchen, preparing ramen for dinner. Emi, now dressed in a tank top and mini shorts, walks in, her face lighting up.

Emi (excitedly): Hmmm, it smells so good. What are you cooking, Shin?

Shin: I’m cooking ramen.

Emi: Oh, I see.

Just then, Ren enters the living room, removing his coat and hat as the smell of ramen fills the air.

Ren: It smells good. What is that? Is that ramen?

Shin (proudly): Ahh, yes.

Ren (sadly): So, you still know how to cook it... I remember that it was Nami’s favorite food.

Shin (disappointed, recalling a memory): Ahh, yes. She once asked me to cook it for her, but I was too dumb and said no.

Shin finishes cooking, serving the ramen with a sigh.

Shin: This is ready. Let’s eat. 

Emi grabs four plates, placing one at the table in memory of Nami.

Ren (noticing): Ooh, you’re including Nami too.

Emi (softly smiling): Ah, yes. Because I know she likes this dish, especially when Shin makes it.

They eat quietly.

It was 10p.m. at night, and there was a curfew. Haruto, wearing his police uniform, drives his police car through the quiet city streets to patrol. As he passes by a house, he spots Emi standing outside, and she is looking at the 2nd floor of their house while wearing her school uniform.

REN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The street is dimly lit. Emi stands outside her house, staring at it in silence. A police car pulls up beside her, and Haruto, a young police officer in his 20s, rolls down the window.

Haruto (concerned): Emi? What are you doing out here this late? What are you staring at your own house for?

Haruto is dressed in his washed blue police uniform, with a badge and police kit visible.

Emi (silent, still staring at the house): ……

Haruto (getting more concerned): Are you okay, Emi?

Emi turns her head slowly and gives Haruto a strange, unsettling smile, but says nothing.

As the day passed and everyone prepared for the next, the routine remained comforting. Shin, as always, assisted in running Ren's restaurant, ensuring everything flowed smoothly. The town seemed peaceful on the surface. Haruto, the only police officer in town, pushed open the door to Ren's restaurant. The familiar chime of the bell announced his arrival. He greeted everyone with a nod and made his way to the counter, his usual serious demeanor softened by the cozy atmosphere of the place.

**REN'S RESTAURANT - DAY**

Shin stands behind the counter of the cozy restaurant. As the bell above the door jingles, Haruto enters, still in his police uniform.

Shin (with a warm smile, handing him a menu): The usual, Haruto?

Haruto (nodding, but looking hesitant): Actually, Shin, I wanted to talk to you about something strange that's been going on around town.

Shin tilts his head slightly, noticing Haruto's unease.

Shin: Something strange? What do you mean?

Haruto (pauses, as if unsure of how to begin): I’ve been noticing things lately... people acting off, reports that don’t make sense. I think something’s happening, and I need your help.

When police officer Haruka mentioned that the Sato family had all vanished, the police officer informed Shin and others that the entire family had suddenly disappeared without a trace. It was a crucial turning point that heightened the tension and deepened the mystery on Sado Island.

Emi ran when she heard about the disappearance of the Sato family because she was struck by fear and a sense of urgency. The Sato were close to her, especially Lekra Sato, a young boy. who was friends with Emi. Hearing that the entire family had vanished without a trace was shocking and terrifying, leading Emi to fear the worst. 

After Emi ran off in a panic upon hearing about the Sato family's disappearance, Shin, concerned for her safety, quickly followed her.

**QUIET STREET - DAY**

Shin splints down the street, panting as he finally catches up to Emi.

Emi (worried): Shin, we need to figure out what’s happening before it’s too late.

Shin (frustrated, but trying to stay calm): I know, Emi. But where do we even start?

Suddenly, a gravelly voice cuts through the darkness.

Daisuke (stepping out from the shadows): I overheard your conversation. It sounds like you’re dealing with something beyond the ordinary.

Emi (startled): Daisuke! We’re trying to understand what happened to the Sato family. Do you know anything about these disappearances?

Daisuke (serious, his voice low): More than you might think. The island has its secrets. I’ve seen things that don’t fit any normal explanation. These shadows you’re talking about—they’re not a new 
phenomenon.

Shin and Emi exchange a nervous glance.

Shin (uneasy): What you’re saying... Are the Shadows real?

Daisuke (nodding, grave): Yes. What you’re dealing with isn’t just a coincidence. These shadows are part of the island’s dark history. They’re doppelgängers—replacements. They mimic people, usually 
before something terrible happens.

Emi (voice shaking): How do they work? Is there a way to stop them?

Daisuke: They’re nearly perfect—looks, memories, everything. But they’re not human. The old tales speak of rituals, symbols that might reveal or repel them. The Shadows are tied to ancient curses and 
the island’s past.

Shin (determined): So, is there something we can do?

Daisuke: Be cautious. The Shadows aren’t just dangerous—they’re cunning. They’ll try to deceive you.

Daisuke turns to leave. 

Daisuke: I’ll gather more information. In the meantime, look into the island’s history. That’s where you’ll find answers.

Daisuke disappears into the night, leaving Shin and Emi standing with their growing concerns.

Shin (sighing, uncertain): So, what do we do now?

Emi (voice trembling): Daisuke said we need to look into the island’s history. But I’m scared. Everything feels so overwhelming.

Shin (gently): I know. We have to focus. If we find what Daisuke was talking about, we might be able to stop whatever’s happening.

Emi: Where should we start?

Shin: Let’s head to the town archives near the forest. We need to learn more about the island’s past. It might give us some answers.

Emi (nodding, though still anxious): Alright. Let’s go. I just hope we find something that can help.

**FOREST - NIGHT**

As they make their way to the town archives, near the forest, the atmosphere is tense. 

After arriving at the archive house, they saw a silhouette of a girl, and Shin and Emi both looked in that direction, which was in the forest. 

Emi: Let’s follow that girl, it might be someone who can help!

grabbing Shin’s hand urgently.

Shin just followed Emi around the forest, and they didn’t see the silhouetted girl. 

Emi: Where’s that girl. 

Shin: I don’t know either. 

Within a moment, A loud gunshut echoes through the trees, sending chills down Shin and Emi's spines.

Emi (panicked, running towards the sound): Let’s go and check that!

Shin, eyes wide with fear, follows Emi through the forest. They arrive at a clearing where they find an ADULT WOMAN collapsed on the ground, her body covered in SLICE WOUNDS, and a GUNSHOT WOUND on 
her left side, blood oozing out

Emi (shaking, horrified): There’s a girl—what are we going to do? She’s bleeding! Let’s call for help!

Emi frantically runs off to find help as Shin kneels by the injured woman, trying to assess the situation. She is pale, her breaths shallow.

Mysterious Woman (weakly, struggling to speak): I’m sorry... I didn’t manage to kill it…

Before Shin can respond, a sharp CRACK rings out—a BULLET pierces the woman's head, killing her instantly.

Shin (frozen in terror): No…

He slowly looks up, too scared to move. The sound came from another UNKNOWN GIRL, standing nearby, holding Emi captive. Emi's head is locked in the girl’s grip, a GUN pressed against her temple. The 
unknown girl wears Emi's school uniform.

Shin (in horror): No! Emi!

Unknown Girl (coldly, eyes empty): You didn’t act fast enough. Now, you see the consequences.

Emi (voice trembling, eyes pleading): Shin... please…

Shin (desperate, panicking): Stop! Please, just let her go!

The unknown girl remains emotionless.

Unknown Girl: Too late for that.

The deafening sound of a GUNSHOT fills the air. The bullet pierces Emi's head. Her body falls limp in the girl's arms.

Shin (collapsing, gasping for breath, voice breaking): Emi, no…

He drops to his knees, stunned, unable to comprehend what just happened.

Shin got shot in the head, realizing that, as the scene unfolds, he is left grappling with the devastating consequences of his inaction.

## Second Chapter

Shin woke up on a boat, where his eyes wandered around, and he checked his phone. He saw his childhood friend Nami on the boat. Nami’s dressed in a plain white summer dress. 

Nami: "Also, please protect Emi," and she disappears.

Shin is shocked at why he's falling and shouting Nami's name. After that, Shin woke up while shouting Nami's name. The mysterious girl next to him was shocked to hear his voice. 

Emi was excited to approach him. She was so excited that she ran to hug Shin; 

she did not realize that there was a car coming towards her. Luckily, the driver saw her immediately to avoid hitting her. 

Shin was surprised as if that had already happened but he didn't know if it was just a dream or just a coincidence

Emi: “Whew, that was close, huh?”

Shin: “Hey, Emi, are you okay? Has anything hurt? ” He asks and stares at Emi’s blue uniform.

Emi: “Oh, no, I’m alright. Thank you for worrying,” she happily said. 

Emi: “However, it’s been a long time since I saw you." 

They walked all the way to Emi's house to change for the funeral.

They arrived at the funeral.

After they arrive at the funeral, Shin gives his sympathy to Nami’s family. He feels a deep sense of unease as he observes the mourners. Shin dreamt about his past 10 years ago, when his parents died 
and the family of Nami’s took him. So he didn’t just think of Nami as just a friend but also his closest family.

Shin: “I’m sorry for your loss. Nami was... She was like a sister to me,” He softly said to Ren.

Ren: “Thank you, Shin. She always spoke fondly of you. It’s just... I still can’t believe she’s gone,” said while wiping his tears.

Shin: “I've been thinking about what happened. Do you think there was anything unusual before…?”

Shin thinks that this really happened, he is confused as if he knows what will happen next, he knows that there are three unknown persons who will talk about him and nami's autopsy.

Shin looked out the window, then suddenly someone hugged his back, and he knew it was  Kenji.

Kenji: “Shin! It’s been a long time; where have you been?! ” crying, snobbing.

Shin was restless as if he was looking for someone

Kenji: “Are you okay, Shin? You seem off. More than usual.” He noticed Shin’s troubled expression.

Shin: “I’m just trying to make sense of everything. Something doesn’t feel right about all this,” sighs, looking back out the window.

While Shin and Kenji were talking, suddenly a camera flashed, and they saw Lekra. Shin noticed the flash coming from behind, so he looked and observed if someone was taking a picture. But there’s no 
one holding a camera. He noticed the little boy staring at him.

Shin: "I knew it" He said in his mind 

he was looking for where the flash came from but he couldn't find anyone with a camera and he saw the boy who looked like the one in his dream

Shin: "That young boy,"

Kenji: "Who? Lekra? his family owned a small convenience store on this island, and he’s the child that Nami rescued in the sea.” He whispered in Shin’s ear, 

Kenji: “My dad and the police did an autopsy on Nami’s body, and there’s a suspicious mark on her neck. Police just decided that the case is an accident because there’s no one around on the water 
when Nami’s saving the drowning child.”

The funeral continues their cultural process. Shin’s wearing a plain polo and black slacks. After the ritual, the priest called Shin to assist in lifting the coffin. 

Shin had a hint of what was going on, as if his dream had come true, but he didn't know if it was real or not.

Fuji: “Shin, can you help us lift the coffin? ” He asks a favor for Shin.

Shin: “Sure, I’m coming over there.”

As time passes by, the things he dreamed about are happening, to the point that he can foresee what will happen next.

Shin and Emi are in the kitchen, and Shin is cooking some ramen for dinner. Emi changed her clothes to her comfy clothes, which are a tank top and a mini short.

Ren arrived in the living room.

Ren: “It smells good. What is that? Is that ramen? ” He asks while removing his coat and hat.

“Ahh yes,” Shin proudly said.

Ren: “So, you still know how to cook them; I remember that being Nami's favorite food”, He sadly said.

Shin: Ahh, yes, I remember. She told me to cook one for her, but I'm too dumb, and I rejected her, He said disappointedly. “This is ready; let's eat,"

Shin takes four plates to show respect to Nami because he wants to give her ramen.

Emi: “Ooh, you’re including Nami too,”

Shin: “Ah yes, because I know that she would love this, especially since it's her request before I left the island.” 

While they were eating, Shin could not stop thinking about what Daisuke said about the shadows, "The shadows are part of the island's dark history." "They mimic people perfectly." "Be cautious, they 
are dangerous.. they will try to deceive you." he said in his mind. He remembered that in his dream, they were killed by the “shadow” in the forest. He thinks that his dream is possible because what 
happened there seems to align with what he dreamed.

Emi: "Shin, are you okay?".

Shin: "Uh yes, I'm okay."

They eat quietly.

Haruto, the only police officer in town, drives his police car through the quiet city streets to patrol. As he passes by a house, he spots Emi standing outside, and she is looking at the 2nd floor of 
their house while wearing her school uniform.

Haruto: “Emi? What are you staring at your own house for? ” Haruto pulled over, rolling down the window of his police car.

Emi keeps on staring.

Emi:  “.....”

Haruto asks, “Are you okay, Emi? ”

But Emi just looked and smiled at him.

As the day passed and everyone prepared for the next, the routine remained comforting. Shin, as always, assisted in running Ren's restaurant, ensuring everything flowed smoothly. The town seemed 
peaceful on the surface.

Shin: "Uncle, Can you cook Haruto's usual order?"

Ren: "Why? Is Haruto here?"

Shin: “No, but I have guts that he will arrive soon.”

After a few minutes,The familiar chime of the bell announced his arrival. It was Haruto. He greeted everyone with a nod and made his way to the counter.

Before Haruto could even speak, Shin walked towards Haruto at the counter holding Haruto’s usual order.


Shin: “Hey Haruto, here’s your usual order.” He greeted him with a warm smile while putting his meal on the table.

Haruto: “Ergh?!” confused.

Haruto:  “How? I wasn’t ordering yet!” 

Shin: “Hehe” he replied while scratching the back of his head. 

Now, Shin was certain that his dream was real.

Haruto: "Actually, Shin, I wanted to talk to you about something strange that's been going on around town.” He nodded but hesitated for a moment before speaking.

Shin: “Is there a lead on where the SATO family is?”

Haruto was confused because before he could say what he was going to say, shin immediately preceded him

Shin is thinking……trying to recall the events that happened in his dream. Then suddenly, he remembered that Emi, Shin himself and a mysterious woman died in his dream. 

As time went by, Haruto could see that Shin was breaking out in a cold sweat, so he immediately asked him.

Haruto:  “Shin? What's on your mind? Are you okay?”

Shin: “Yeah I’m okay, but ahmmm can I take a minute?” He replied immediately.

Shin hurriedly went to Ren

Shin: “Ren, can I take a break? I need to do something”

Shin ran out of the restaurant and rushed into the forest to find the mysterious girl that appeared in his dream to save her. Shin is panting as he recalls the woman being shot and fighting for her 
life.

Shin arrived quickly and was curious about the woman's whereabouts. Suddenly, he heard a woman's voice shouting, 

Mysterious woman: "Run!"

He looked in the direction from which the voice came and saw a girl running toward him. They then hid behind a huge tree.

While they were in hiding, they heard the sound of the unknown girl getting closer. The mysterious girl raised her shotgun and aimed at the unknown girl, but only managed to graze her arm with the 
shot.

The mysterious girl wanted to kill the unknown girl, but she thought that the boy would be a burden if he got hurt, so she decided that they both fled to a safer place.

Mysterious girl: “What are you doing here?”

Shin: “I’m trying to save your life here!” 

Mysterious girl:“Save my life? HAHAHAHAHA. You're so funny. You'll get yourself killed,”

As the woman burst into laughter, Shin suddenly shouted.

Shin: “In my dream, You're gonna get killed by that thing, and everyone important to me is gonna die!” 

Mysterious girl: “What?!” The woman replied with curiosity.

Shin: “I am Shin, Shin Fujiwara,” Shin said while he is panting.

The mysterious girl was shocked by what he said.

Mysterious girl: “Shin Fujiwara???” she said in confusion.

Shin: “Everything that happened in my dream came true. I know it may sound crazy, but that is the truth,” Shin explained. “The one who's going to kill you is a ‘shadow’, and that’s what we 
encountered before.” he added.

Mysterious girl:"So, you know about the shadow as well. I believe what you're saying," The mysterious girl replied. "Tell me more about what you know from your dream."

As they continued their conversation about his dream.

RESTAURANT SCENE 

Ren wonders why Shin hasn't returned yet, so she asks Emi to look for him. 

Ren: "Emi, can you look for Shin? He has not returned since he left," 

Emi: "Okay, I'll go now," 

As Emi walks, she thinks about where Shin might have gone. She reaches the forest in search of Shin. While walking through the forest, she notices a girl entering.

Emi:"Hey! Where are you going?!" She shouts. 

She follows the girl out of curiosity. As she searches for the girl, someone touches her shoulder. When she turns around, she's shocked to see that the girl looks exactly like her.

Emi: "Wh- Who are you?" she asked, her voice trembling with fear.

Emi saw that she was about to be stabbed, and immediately screamed. Shin and Amaya heard the scream, so Amaya quickly handed a knife to Shin and they rushed to where they heard the scream.

Amaya and Shin were panting as they ran to find the girl.

When they reached where the scream came from, Shin was shocked when he saw Emi lying on the ground, bleeding heavily and weak. 

Shin:"Emi, no!" He shouted with a trembling voice.

Bagangggg!#%@ The loud noise from the shotgun as it fired

Amaya quickly took action, firing her gun at the shadow that looked just like Emi. The shadow dodged, and she and Shin rushed to Emi, who was lying on the ground.

Shin: "Emi... Emiii... wake up," Shin called out.

Emi: "Who is that? Why does it look like me?" Emi asked weakly.

Shin: "Shh, it's okay, Emi. We will save you no matter what. I promise," Shin assured her.

Shin positioned Emi to lean against a nearby tree for support and then turned to Amaya.

Shin:  "Wait for me, Emi. I need to help Amaya."

Shin grabbed the knife Amaya had given him and sprinted towards her to help. Bang! Cluck! Bang! Cluck! Bang! The sound of Amaya's gunshots echoed. She realized her bullets were running out; she had 
only two left.

Amaya: "Shin, I only have two bullets left," Amaya shouted, blood dripping from her left hand.

They didn't notice the shadow heading closer to Emi. Amaya shot at it, but the shadow avoided it.

Bang! A shotgun sounds like this.

Amaya: "Damn it! I missed!" Amaya muttered, frustration in her voice.

Shin: "Emiiiiiii!" Shin shouts as he hurries towards Emi.

Shluk!

Shin and Amaya froze, their eyes widening in terror as they witnessed the shadow stabbed Emi without hesitation.

Shin charged towards the shadow, his face altered in hatred.

Shin: "Emi, no!"

 he shouted, his voice trembling with rage as he rushed for the shadow holding a knife.

Shin: "Don't die, Emi! I will save you; hold on!" Shin said.

Shik! Swoosh! Shik! Swoosh!

Shin tried to stab the shadow, but it kept evading him. He noticed Amaya was weakening, and Emi was unconscious, motionless. It was as if the shadow was toying with him.

Shin: "Waaaahhhhhhhh..." Shin let out a desperate cry. As he attempted to strike again, the shadow moved faster and stabbed him in the arm.

Shin: "Ahh!" 

Shin collapsed to his knees, pain tearing through his body.

Shin's thoughts raced as he breathed deeply.  He was unsure if Emi was still alive, lost in a whirlwind of thoughts about how to save her.

Until... It suddenly hit on him. His dream was not only a dream. He knew he could travel back in time, but he had no idea how or whether it was possible.

The shadow moved closer to Amaya, preparing to kill her next.

Shin: "Damn it! How do I go back to the past?" Shin wondered desperately.

The shadow was about to kill Amaya when Shin yelled, 

Shin: "AMAYA, THROW ME THE GUN!"

Both the shadow and Amaya stopped being taken by surprise.

Amaya: "It's too late! We can't kill it with just this last bullet!" Amaya said, her voice weakening and her body covered in blood.

Shin: "Trust me! Throw me the gun!" Shin's voice was determined and persistent.

Amaya threw the gun to Shin.

Kishk!! (Gun Sound)

The shadow smirked, certain that it was capable of avoiding Shin's final bullet. But when Shin did not point the gun at the shadow, its confident expression instantly changed to confusion, as did Amaya's. Instead, he pointed to his own head.

Amaya: "What are you doing, Shin? Don't give up hope! Don't kill yourself!" Amaya said, her voice filled with fear.

Shin was panting heavily.

Shin: "Trust me. I'll be back. I'll save you and Emi," he said his eyes filled with terror as he struggled with his own words.

Amaya stared at him, confused by his actions.

Shin: "I promise, I'll come back and save you!" Shin added, tears flowing down his face.

Bang! The gun went off.

Suddenly, everything went dark.

## Third Chapter

Narrator: Shin woke up still hearing the gunfire aimed at him, as he overflowed with memories and emotions from his previous life. As he regained consciousness standing on the same boat, event, he started to realize this was no mere coincidence nor a mere dream, however, he was still unsure why this was happening before he could think of another thought,
“Shin snaps back to reality as he hears Emi’s voice (Emi’s voice shouted his name), as she excitedly runs towards him”

Narrator: Same as before Emi ignores the fact there is a car about to cross the road, Shin observes as if he is trying to test something regarding his memory, wherein the driver luckily saw Emi running and stopped on time.

“As Emi crosses the road, the driver sees her and immediately avoids hitting her.” 

Shin: “Shin's suspicion slowly fades as he confirms that his dream was not just a coincidence but an event from a previous memory.”

Emi: “Whew, that was close, huh? ” (Emi said.)

Shin: “Hey, Are you okay? Are you Hurt?” (He asks as he observes Emi “worriedly” for injuries)

Emi: “Oh, no, I’m alright. Thank you for worrying,” she happily said. 

Emi: “It’s been a long time since I saw you, how was the city?” she asked curiously.

Shin: “The city life was a lot more different than when I was here, I can tell a story on our way home”

(Emi and Shin laugh and murmur)

Narrator: both of them shared stories and laughs as they walked home to change in preparation for the funeral

Narrator: As both of them are about to arrive at the funeral place, Shin seems to be on high alert with the people thinking the shadows might be one of them, And he sees a familiar face.

Shin: “Emi you go ahead to the funeral place, I need to do something I'll catch up in a bit”

Emi: “Okay, don't keep us waiting”

“Emi walks away headed to the venue”

“Shin sprints towards the familiar Someone”

Shin: “Ms. Amaya, I am Shin” said with enthusiasm

“Amaya is confused at first but slowly she understands what Shin is trying to say”

Shin: “I know this might sound crazy but you are going to die in the next few days, and i'm here to tell you I'm going to save you and emi from danger all you need to do is to trust me” said with 
confidence

“Amaya is puzzled but he sees Shin’s eye and know he's telling the truth”

Amaya: “Okay, Find me after the funeral” As she walks away

Shin excitedly bows and runs away”

“Shin headed back to catch up with Emi”

Narrator: “As both of them entered the room, Shin felt the chill in the air as he entered the room full of people, as he is unfamiliar with most of them since its been a while since his last visit”

Shin: ”I am deeply sorry for your loss… I wish I was there to protect her, she was… she was like a sister, a family to me..” said with sadness and grief.

Ren: “Thank you, Shin... She always spoke fondly of you. It’s just... I still can’t believe she’s gone,” said while wiping his tears.

Shin: “Dont worry, I am going to find out what happened and bring justice to Nami,” said intensely

“Shin starts to wander finding someone, to confirm something”

“A camera flushes in the crowd of people, and in the location of the light something happened”

“Shin takes a peek and sees a young boy named Lekra”

“Shin watches and observes Lekra’s every move as he tries being spotted by it, trying his best to avoid contact”

“Satisfied with his quest, Shin leaves to find Kenji”

“Kenji, Hugged the lost Shin from behind”

Kenji: “Shin! It’s been a long time; where have you been?! ” crying, snobbing.

Shin: “Hey, Kenji I was just looking for you”

As the two of them catch up, the funeral ritual continues, as soon as the ritual ends Shin heads out to find Amaya

**In the Forest**

Amaya, staying and laying low in the forest waiting for shin.

Shin: Ms. Amaya, thank you for meeting me up here but right now we do not have much time left. I need you to come with me. 

Both of them hurriedly left and amaya followed shin up until they arrived in front of a house. The Sato's residence. 

When shin was about to knock..

Lekra: AAAAAAAHHH..

Shin and amaya both looked at each other and hurriedly tried to break in the house. When they have successfully broke the door, there they saw a horrifying scene. 

Lekra on the floor and another child who seems to look like him holding a knife pointed at Lekra..
Bloods are on the floor but not of Lekra's, but of his parents who was lying on the floor.

Lekra's shadow puzzled as to why is shin and amaya is in their house, with no time to waste..

Shin: Lekra! (positions himself in front of lekra and put the child away from the shadow)

Amaya holds out her gun and pointed it to Lekra's Shadow.

Lekra's Shadow: Why are you here?

Shin: Who are you?

Lekra's Shadow: I am asking you. Why are you here?

Shin: I will not answer you. What do you guys want?

Lekra's Shadow: *chuckles* I guess i need to have all of you killed. 

Amaya shot lekra's shadow but was easily evaded. 

**Glitches**

Just when lekra's shadow was about to attack..

Emi: *Shouts* Lekra? are you here? i know you're shocked for what happened to my sister but..

Lekra's Shadow: Tsk. 

Unknown Shadow Appeared.

Unknown Shadow: It's time to go, finish this at another time. 

Lekra's Shadow: *smiled creepily* you can't stop us.

Shin: (internal dialogue) - with all these proof i think we can convince the people of the island that there is something wrong going on here. 

Amaya: I wont let you get away!

Amaya shot again the shadows.

Before disappearing, the shadows consumed all the evidences available on the floor including the bodies of lekra's parents and their blood stains.

Shin: No !!

The shadows disappeared right in front of their eyes.
Defeated, Shin has his heart beating too fast and tries to process the information they have seen. 

Shin:(internal Dialogue) - so that's why! that is why when the sato family disappeared we cannot find them and not even a clue was left inside their residence!

Amaya: Shin. while looking at the door

Emi: Shin? Ah Lekra! what happened here shin? and who is this girl?

Shin: I will explain later. Let's get out of here.
