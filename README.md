## First Chapter

Shin Tachibana is a high school student who left Sado Island years ago, hoping for the city's excitement, bright lights, and endless possibilities. But when he received news of Nami's death, something pulled him back. He couldn’t understand it—a sense of duty, maybe—or the gnawing guilt that he had left behind those he cared about most. Nami is a high school student who has been his best friend, the girl who dared him to explore the darkest caves, who laughed with him under the summer stars, and who has been there for him when no one else was. 

Shin woke up on a boat, where his eyes wandered around, and he checked his phone. He saw his childhood friend Nami on the boat. Nami’s dressed in a plain white summer dress.  

**AT THE SHIP – DAY** 

Scene 1: The Encounter 

Shin, falling and shouting Nami's name, jolted awake, still calling for her. His voice echoed in the quiet street. Disoriented, he noticed a mysterious girl nearby, startled by his outburst. 

Shin: "Nami!" 

He sat up, rubbing his head. "Sorry, I didn’t mean to shout..." 

The girl remained silent but curious, watching him. 

Player Choice: 

**a. Ask the girl if she knows Nami.** 

Shin: "Do you know someone named Nami?" 

The girl shook her head, confused. 

Girl: "Nami? No, maybe it was just a dream?" 

Outcome: This leaves Shin doubting his memories, sparking a quest to uncover the truth about Nami and her connection to the island's Shadows. 

**b. Apologize again for the outburst.** 

Shin: "Sorry for scaring you." 

The girl smiled faintly. 

Girl: "It's okay. I was just worried." 

Outcome: It sets a tone of vulnerability and openness. By apologizing again, Shin shows that he’s self-aware and considerate of others' feelings, which helps in building rapport with the mysterious girl.  

**c. Try to remember the dream.** 

Shin: "What was I dreaming about...? Nami, and then..." But the details slipped away, leaving only a sense of dread. 

Outcome: This pushes Shin to rely on his intuition, believing the dream holds vital clues about the island’s curse. He begins seeking ways to recover the dream's fragments, deepening his connection to the supernatural. 

Scene 2: Arriving on Sado Island 

Shin and Emi arrive at Sado Island, stepping off the ship into the cool, salty air. Emi, excited to see Shin, rushes toward him, not noticing a car speeding toward her. 

Shin: "Emi!" (The car's brakes screech as it barrels toward her.) 

Player Choice: 

**a.Yell at Emi to stop.** 

Shin: "Emi, stop!" Emi freezes in confusion as the car swerves, narrowly missing her. 

Outcome: Emi feels embarrassed and reveals she thought she saw someone familiar, adding mystery but straining their relationship slightly. 

**b. Run and grab Emi.** 

Shin rushes forward, pulling Emi back just as the car screeches past. They tumble to the ground. 

Outcome: If the player chooses option b, where Shin runs and grabs Emi just as 	the car barrels toward her, the scene becomes a tense, action-packed moment that heightens the urgency of their reunion. As the car screeches past, missing them by inches, Shin and Emi fall to the ground in a heap, hearts racing.  

**c. Stand back and let the driver handle it.** 

Shin hesitates, and the car screeches to a halt just inches from Emi. The driver honks and speeds away. 

Outcome: Emi feels upset and betrayed, causing tension and mistrust between them. 

**STREET – DAY**

(Emi and Shin Walk side by side, catching their breath after the close call.) 

Emi (sighing with relief): "Whew, that was close, huh?" 

Shin (concerned, eyeing her blue school uniform): "Are you okay? Did anything 	hurt?" 

(The camera lingers on Emi, her blue uniform contrasting with the surroundings; she’s Nami’s younger sister, still in high school.) 

Emi (smiling brightly): "I’m alright! Thanks for worrying." 

(They continue walking toward Emi's house, the mood lightening as they chat.) 

Emi: "It’s been so long since I saw you!" 

(Shin nods, reflecting on the time that’s passed.) 

Scene 1: Arriving at the Funeral 

Shin and Emi arrive at the funeral site in Sado, where the warm summer light contrasts with the heavy atmosphere.  

Player Choice: 

**a. Look around for suspicious behavior.** 

Shin scans the mourners, noting a man standing apart, staring at him intensely. 

Shin (thinking): "Who is that? Why is he watching me?" 

The man suddenly vanishes into the crowd. 

Outcome: Shin’s suspicion grows, planting seeds of doubt about those around him and leading to potential trust issues. 

**b. Recall his dream about the past.** 

Shin (thinking): "Nami... and my parents... did this all start 10 years ago?" 

He remembers the day Nami’s family took him in after his parents' tragic accident, a sense of dread washing over him. 

Outcome: The outcome of this scene marks a turning point for Shin, both emotionally and narratively. As he recalls the past while attending Nami’s funeral, the memories of his parents’ tragic accident resurface, overwhelming him with feelings of guilt and loss.  

**c. Approach Nami’s family to offer condolences.** 

Shin: "I’m so sorry for your loss." 

Outcome: Nami's family graciously accepts his condolences, but their grief reveals deeper pain, increasing Shin’s empathy while hinting they may be hiding more about Nami’s death. 

Scene 2: At the funeral  

As the funeral progresses, Shin stands at the back, feeling increasingly uneasy. The familiar surroundings distort, and the faces of mourner's blur together. 

Player Choice: What does Shin think about? 

**a. The mysterious shadows he saw before Nami’s death.** 

Shin (thinking): "I saw something that night... shadows... but no one believes me. Could they be linked to Nami's death?" 

Outcome: A chilling sense of dread builds, leading Shin to suspect a supernatural cause behind her death. 

**b. His connection to Nami’s family.**  

Shin (thinking): "They saved me when I lost everything. Nami was like my sister."  

Outcome: His loyalty deepens, motivating him to solve the mystery out of respect for Nami and her family. 

**c. A strange feeling that Nami’s death is the beginning of something.** 

Shin (thinking): "This doesn’t feel right... Nami’s death seems like the start of something darker." 

Outcome: A darker realization dawns, igniting Shin's obsession with uncovering a larger conspiracy or sinister force at play on the island. 

Scene 3: Unveiling the past 

After the funeral service, Shin stands outside, staring at the ocean. The rhythmic crashing of the wave contrasts with his turbulent thoughts as a chilling realization surface. 

Player Choice: How does Shin feel about Nami’s death? 

**a. Suspicious.** 

Shin (thinking): "There’s no way this was just an accident. I need to find out 		what really happened." 

Outcome: Determined to uncover the truth, Shin resolves to search for clues and question anyone who might know more. 

**b. Grief-stricken.** 

Shin (thinking): "I can’t believe she’s gone... and I couldn’t do anything to 	stop it." 

Outcome: Overwhelmed by pain, he feels lost but is driven to search for answers, despite his uncertainty. 

**c. Confused.** 

Shin (thinking): "I don’t understand... but something about this funeral, about the island, feels wrong." 

Outcome: His confusion sparks curiosity, compelling him to piece together the unsettling mystery surrounding Nami's death. 

**FUNERAL HALL**  

Shin stands across from Ren, Nami and Emi's father, amidst the mourners, their conversation tense and private. 

Shin (softly): "I’m sorry for your loss. Nami was like a sister to me." 

Ren (wiping tears): "Thank you, Shin. She always spoke fondly of you. I still can’t believe she’s gone." 

Shin (hesitant): "I’ve been thinking about what happened. Do you think anything was unusual before...?" 

Ren (confused): "Unusual? No, she was her usual self. Why do you ask?" 

Shin (lowering his voice): "I just have this feeling that we’re missing something." 

Ren (nervously): "This was just a tragic accident, right?" 

Shin (somber): "I hope so, but something doesn’t feel natural." 

Ren (fear creeping in): "What are you saying?" 

Shin: "I don’t know yet, but I owe it to Nami to uncover the truth." 

Ren wipes his eyes and walks away, leaving Shin alone with his thoughts. He overhears two people nearby. 

Unknown Person 1: "Is that Shin?" 

Unknown Person 2: "Yeah, he lost his best friend." 

Shin, lost in thought, suddenly feels arms wrap around him. He turns to see Kenji, dressed in a white polo shirt and black slacks, tears in his eyes. 

Kenji (sobbing): "Shin! It’s been a long time; where have you been?!" 

Shin (managing a smile): "Kenji! You dressed up for this, huh?" 

Kenji: "Yeah, it’s the least I could do for Nami. She deserves our respect." 

Suddenly, a flash of light catches Shin’s eye, startling him. It appeared like a camera flash, but no one was holding a camera. 
ayer Choice: What does Shin do? 

**a. Approach the little boy who’s staring at him.**

Shin notices a young boy standing still in the corner, staring at him intently. Something about the boy feels off. 

Shin (quietly to himself): "Who is that kid? Why is he staring at me like that?" 

Shin (walking toward the boy): "Hey, were you taking pictures?" (The boy doesn’t answer, his expression blank.) 

Outcome: A deeper sense of unease sets in, and Shin becomes more certain that something supernatural is afoot, possibly connected to the boy. 

**b. Look around the room for the source of the flash.** 

Shin quickly scans the room, his heart pounding. There’s no camera, no 	one taking photos. The flash of light seems to have disappeared as quickly as it appeared. 

Shin (thinking): "What the hell was that? Am I imagining things?" 

Outcome: A creeping paranoia begins to affect Shin’s perceptions, making him question his own sanity as strange events continue to unfold. 

**c. Ask Kenji if he saw the flash.** 

Shin (turning to Kenji): "Hey, did you see that flash just now?" 

Kenji (confused): "Flash? I didn’t see anything. Are you sure you’re alright, Shin?" Shin frowns, unsure of what he just experienced. 

Shin (thinking): "Was I the only one who saw it?" 

Outcome: Isolation increases, as Shin begins to wonder if he’s the only one who can see the truth, or if he’s losing his grip on reality. 

Player Choice: How does Shin respond to the growing mystery? 

**a. Decide to investigate further on his own.**

Shin takes a deep breath, making a silent decision to investigate the strange occurrences on the island, starting with Nami’s death. 

Shin (thinking): "I’ll find out what’s really going on, even if no one else believes me." 

Outcome: Shin’s resolve strengthens, and he sets out on a solitary path, determined to face the darkness head-on. 

**b. Tell Kenji about the feeling that something’s wrong.** 

Shin (to Kenji): "I don’t think this was just an accident, Kenji. Something’s not right on this island." 

Kenji (concerned): "What do you mean? You’re starting to freak me out, Shin." 

Outcome: Shin’s resolve strengthens, and he sets out on a solitary path, determined to face the darkness head-on. 

**c. Confront the boy directly about what he saw.** 

Shin (stepping closer to the boy): "Did you see something just now? What are you looking at?" 

The boy’s expression doesn’t change. Instead, he quietly turns and walks away. 

Outcome: The boy's cryptic behavior deepens the mystery, leaving Shin even more confused and desperate for answers as the boy walks away without a word. \
FUNERAL HALL - DAY 

Shin (thinking to himself): "What was that flash?" His eyes shift towards a young 	boy standing in the distance. 

Shin (whispering to Kenji): "Who is that young boy?" 

Kenji (whispering back): "Ahh, that’s Lekra. His family owns a small convenience 	store on the island. He’s the child Nami rescued in the sea." 

Kenji: "My dad and the police did an autopsy on Nami’s body... and there’s a 		suspicious mark on her neck." 

Shin (shocked): "What?! Does anyone know about it?" 

Kenji (in a hushed tone): "Only you, the police, my father, and me. The police ruled 	it as an accident because no one was around when Nami saved the drowning 	kid." 

Shin (stunned): "What...?" 

Kenji: "Let’s talk about it later. I’ll call you." 

Their conversation is cut short as the funeral continues with cultural rituals. The priest stands near the coffin, chanting softly as the ceremony progresses. Mourners bow their heads in respect. 

Fuji: "Shin, can you help us lift the coffin?" 

Shin (nodding): "Sure, I’m coming." 

Shin and a few others carefully lift the coffin, placing it into the back of the car that will transport Nami’s body.  

Player Choice: How does Shin react to Kenji’s revelation? 

**a. Decide to investigate the suspicious mark on Nami’s neck after the funeral.** 

Shin makes a silent vow to investigate what really happened to Nami. Something 	about the mark feels important, like a clue to her mysterious death. 

Shin (thinking): "I need to find out what caused that mark. Maybe Lekra knows 	something." 

Outcome: Shin’s resolve to uncover the truth strengthens. He decides to start by 	finding out what caused the mark, hoping it will lead him to the answers 		surrounding Nami’s mysterious death. 

**b. Ask Lekra directly about the day Nami rescued him.** 

Shin glances over at Lekra, the young boy who Nami saved from drowning.  

Shin (thinking): "I should talk to him, see if he remembers anything." (Shin approaches Lekra after the ceremony.) 

Shin (gently): "Hey, Lekra. I wanted to ask you about the day Nami saved you. Do you remember anything unusual?" 

Outcome: Lekra’s cryptic responses and distant demeanor make Shin uneasy, 	but they also raise more questions. Did Lekra see something? This conversation 	plants the seed of suspicion in Shin’s mind about the boy, urging him to investigate 	further. 

**c. Confront the police about why they ruled Nami’s death an accident.** 

Shin decides that he won’t let this mystery rest. He’s going to the police to 	find out why they ruled Nami’s death an accident despite the suspicious 	mark on her neck. 

Shin (thinking): "There’s no way I’m letting this go. The police need to give me some answers." 

Outcome: The police are dismissive, frustrating Shin further. However, they drop a few hints that make Shin realize they may be hiding more than they’re saying.  

Scene Transition: After the Funeral 

As the car pulls away with Nami’s coffin, Shin stands at the edge of the funeral hall, staring after it.  

Player Choice: What does Shin do next? 

**a. Meet up with Kenji to discuss the autopsy results further.** 

Later that evening, Shin meets Kenji to talk in private. Kenji looks tense, glancing over his shoulder as they sit down. 

Kenji: "Shin, I didn’t tell you everything earlier. There’s something else..."(Kenji pulls out a small notebook, flipping to a page with a sketch of the mark on Nami’s neck.) 

Outcome: Kenji’s revelation about the mark deepens Shin’s suspicion. There’s something abnormal about it, something that doesn’t fit with a simple accident. 

**b. Follow Lekra to his family’s convenience store to question him.** 

Shin follows Lekra discreetly as he walks back towards the convenience store. The boy seems unaware of Shin’s presence.  

Shin (thinking): "I need to know what he saw that day. There’s more to this 	story." 

Outcome: Lekra’s reaction is unsettling. His avoidance and cryptic responses only heighten Shin’s suspicion that he knows more than he’s letting on. 

**c. Investigate the area where Nami saved Lekra from drowning.** 

Shin heads to the beach where Nami saved Lekra. The waves crash 		against the shore, but the place feels ominous.  

Shin (thinking): "If something happened here, there must be some kind of 	evidence." 

Outcome: Shin discovers subtle but telling clues—disturbed sand, broken branches, and something shiny in the water. These minor details convince him that Nami’s death wasn’t an accident and that the beach holds secrets waiting to be uncovered.

**REN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT**

Shin is in the kitchen, finishing up the ramen as Emi enters, now dressed casually. The atmosphere is warm but underlined with sadness. 

Emi (excitedly): "Hmmm, it smells so good. What are you cooking, Shin?" 

Shin (smiling softly): "I’m cooking ramen." 

Emi (grinning): "Oh, I see." 

Just then, Ren enters the living room, removing his coat and hat, the smell of ramen filling the air. 

Ren (sighing softly): "It smells good. What is that? Ramen?" 

Shin (proudly): "Yeah, it’s ramen." 

Ren (sadly): "So, you still know how to cook it... I remember it was Nami’s favorite." 

Shin’s smile fades as he recalls a painful memory. 

Shin (disappointed): "Yeah... she once asked me to make it for her, but I was too stubborn and said no. I regret that now." 

Ren (noticing): "Ooh, you’re including Nami too." 

Emi (softly smiling): "Yeah... I just thought she should have a place at the table. She would’ve loved this, especially since Shin made it." 

Player Choice: How does Shin handle the memory of Nami during dinner? 

**a. Stay quiet and eat, holding back his emotions.** 

Shin quietly eats his ramen, the weight of regret sitting heavily on his chest. He doesn’t want to ruin the moment, but the silence between them feels 	louder than words. 

Outcome: The dinner passes in heavy silence, with Shin quietly internalizing his grief. Although Ren and Emi sense his pain, they don’t press him. The atmosphere grows somber, as the unspoken bond of shared loss hangs over them. 

**b. Open about a fond memory with Nami.** 

Shin (softly, trying to lighten the mood): "I remember the time Nami made ramen for me when I was feeling down. She burned the noodles, but it was still the best meal I’ve ever had." The group smiles faintly, the bittersweet memory hanging in the air. 

Outcome: The group shares a quiet moment of reflection, the memory evoking a mix of warmth and sadness. Shin's soft words break through the tension, reminding everyone of Nami's kind gesture, even if it wasn't perfect. 

**c. Express regret about never making ramen for Nami when she asked.** 

Shin (sighing deeply): "I still regret not making ramen for her when she asked. If I had known..." 

Ren (nodding): "We all have regrets, Shin. But she knew you cared." 

Outcome: Ren and Emi smile faintly at the memory, their hearts warmed by Shin’s recollection.

**CITY STREETS - NIGHT**
At 10 PM, with curfew in place, Haruto drives his patrol car through the quiet streets and spots Emi outside her house, staring up at the second floor. 

Player Choice: How does Haruto handle see Emi outside during curfew? 

**a. Stop and talk to Emi.** 

Haruto pulls over and approaches her. 

Haruto: "Emi? It’s curfew. What are you doing out here?" 

Emi: "I... thought I saw someone in the window..." 

Outcome: Their shared sense of loss deepens as they confront their emotions about Nami’s death, fueling Shin’s determination to seek the truth. 

**b. Observe her from a distance.** 

Haruto chooses to watch Emi from the car as she remains frozen, staring at the window. 

Haruto (thinking): "Why is she just standing there? Something feels off..." 

Outcome: An unsettling feeling grows, prompting Haruto to step out of the car, 	sensing that something is wrong. 

**c. Call out to her from the car.** 

Haruto lowers his window. 

Haruto: "Emi, it’s curfew. You should head back inside." 

Emi turns slowly, distant. 

Emi: "I thought I saw Nami." 

Outcome: A shiver runs through Haruto at the mention of Nami, deepening his 	concern about the unnatural happenings surrounding them. 

REN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 

The dimly lit street casts an eerie vibe as Emi stands frozen outside her home, staring at the second floor. Haruto, the town's only police officer, pulls up in his patrol car, sensing something is wrong. 

Haruto (concerned): "Emi? What are you doing out here this late?" 

Emi remains silent, her gaze fixed on the house. Haruto steps out, his concern 	growing. 

Haruto (gently): "Are you okay, Emi?" 

Player Choice: How does Haruto respond to Emi’s behavior? 

**a. Press Emi further.** 

Haruto steps closer, his voice firm yet gentle. 

Haruto: "Emi, this isn’t like you. Tell me what’s going on." 

Outcome: Emi’s smile fades. 

**b. Try to lighten the mood.** 

Haruto (teasing): "What, did your house grow bigger overnight?" 

Outcome: Emi forces a laugh, her eyes distant. 

Emi (softly): "It’s nothing... I was just... lost in thought." Haruto feels the unease linger as she walks back inside. 

**c. Ask her if she’s been having strange dreams.** 

Haruto: "Emi, have you been seeing things or strange shadows?" 

Emi: "Sometimes... but I’m sure I saw her this time." 

Outcome: Concern deepens for Haruto as he considers the possibility of a supernatural link to Nami's death, resolving to keep a closer watch on Emi. 

**REN'S RESTAURANT - DAY**

The next day is business as usual in the small coastal town of Sado. Shin, as always, is busy assisting Ren with the restaurant. The peaceful routine of the town seems comforting on the surface, but there’s a growing sense of unease.  

Haruto (nodding): "Morning." 

Shin (curious): "You seem off. Everything okay?" 

Haruto takes a sip of tea, thinking about the strange encounter with Emi the night before. 

Player Choice: How does Haruto approach the subject with Shin and Ren? 

**a. Confide in Shin about Emi’s strange behavior last night.** 

Haruto (quietly): "Shin, something strange happened last night. I found Emi outside, staring at her house like she’d seen a ghost." 

Outcome: Shin frowns, his own sense of unease deepening. 

Shin (nodding): "That doesn’t sound like her. Did she say anything?" Haruto shakes his head, feeling unsettled by the memory.  

This conversation opens a new layer of mystery, as Ren and Haruto now share a growing concern about Emi’s behavior. 

**b. Keep it to himself and focus on his patrol duties.** 

Haruto (shaking his head): "Nah, just tired from last night’s patrol." 

Outcome: Haruto keeps the strange incident to himself, but the lingering discomfort remains. He continues with his day, but the feeling that something is wrong on the island grows stronger. 

**c. Ask Ren if he’s noticed anything strange with Emi lately.** 

Haruto (serious): "Ren, has Emi been acting differently? I saw her outside late last night, staring at your house. It was... strange." 

Outcome: Ren pauses, looking concerned. 

Ren: "She’s been quiet since Nami’s death. I thought it was just grief, but maybe... maybe it’s something more.” 

**QUIET STREET – DAY** 

Shin and Emi approach the Sato family home, their minds racing with thoughts of the mysterious disappearance. The eerie silence is broken by the deliberate footsteps of Daisuke, the island's grizzled hunter, emerging from an alley with his rifle slung over his back. 

Daisuke (gruff but intrigued): "You two seem in quite a hurry. What’s got you all worked up?" 

Shin (curious, but wary): "Daisuke... it’s the Sato family. They’ve disappeared." 

Daisuke (quiet, but serious): "The Satos, you say? Well, that’s troubling. Disappearing folks aren't new on this island, you know." 

Emi (anxious): "Do you know anything about it? Please, Daisuke, if you know something, tell us!" 

Daisuke (muttering): "There’s talk... stories. Old stories. Folks vanish, sometimes for no good reason. Might be tied to things older than this town—things best left 	alone." 

Shin (pressing): "What are you saying? Are you telling us there’s something else at play here?" 

Daisuke: "This island has secrets, boy. Dark ones. And those who dig too deep... well, sometimes they don’t come back." 

Emi (resolute): "I don’t care about the stories. The Satos are in danger. We must find them!" 

Daisuke: "If you’re hell-bent on going after them, you’ll need more than courage. Follow me—I know where we might start." 

Player Choice: How do Shin and Emi respond to Daisuke’s warning? 

**a. Trust Daisuke’s knowledge and follow him.** 

Shin: "Alright, we’ll follow you. Lead the way." Shin exchanges a look with 	Emi, then nods at Daisuke. 

Outcome: Daisuke leads them through the woods toward an old, abandoned path he claims holds the key to the mystery. The atmosphere grows more tense and foreboding, as they get closer to uncovering the island’s dark secrets. This path further explores the story's supernatural elements. 

**b. Question Daisuke’s motives and decide to investigate the Sato house alone.** 

Shin: "We’ll handle this ourselves. Thanks for the warning, but we’re checking the Sato house first." Shin narrows his eyes at Daisuke, unsure of whether to trust him. 

Outcome: Shin and Emi proceed to the Sato house without Daisuke. Upon 	arriving, they find the house in a state of disarray—furniture overturned, strange symbols scrawled on the walls. 

**c. Convince Daisuke to tell them everything he knows before following him.** 

Shin steps forward, his voice firm. 

Shin: "We’re not going anywhere until you tell us exactly what you know, Daisuke. No more cryptic warnings." 

Outcome: Daisuke sighs, seeing their determination. 

Daisuke: "Alright, fine. There’s an old legend about this island. Those who disappear are said to have been taken by something... not of this world.” 

**NEAR THE TOWN ARCHIVES - NIGHT**

(Emi and Shin Walk side by side, catching their breath after the close call.) 

Emi (sighing with relief): "Whew, that was close, huh?" 

Shin (concerned, eyeing her blue school uniform): "Are you okay? Did anything 	hurt?" 

(The camera lingers on Emi, her blue uniform contrasting with the surroundings; she’s Nami’s younger sister, still in high school.) 

Emi (smiling brightly): "I’m alright! Thanks for worrying." 

(They continue walking toward Emi's house, the mood lightening as they chat.) 

Emi: "It’s been so long since I saw you!" 

(Shin nods, reflecting on the time that’s passed.) 

Player Choice: What should Shin and Emi do next? 

**a. Search the Archive for Historical Records about the Island.** 

Shin and Emi enter the archives, the smell of dust and old paper filling the air. They move cautiously through the rows of shelves, their eyes scanning for anything that might hint at the island’s dark past. 

Emi (whispering, while pulling a book from the shelf): "Here’s something about ancient rituals... It talks about the island’s settlers." 

Shin (flipping through another document): "I found something too. It mentions disappearances in the past, similar to what’s happening now." 

Outcome: They discover an old journal detailing rituals meant to ward off the 	Shadows, but it’s incomplete. The journal mentions a hidden location in the forest where the full ritual can be found. 

**b. Investigating the Symbol Daisuke Mentioned.** 

Shin (pointing to a page in a dusty tome): "Look at this, Emi. This symbol—it’s like the one we saw near the Sato house." 

Emi (leaning closer): "What does it mean?" 

Shin (thoughtful): "It’s part of a warding ritual." We need to figure out where these symbols are placed around the island." 

Outcome: They uncover a map with marked locations across the island where 	protective symbols were once placed. 

**c. Confront the Shadows Directly.** 

Emi grabs Shin’s arm, her voice full of resolve. 

Emi: "I can’t just sit here, Shin. If the Shadows are taking people, we have to confront them—before more disappear." 

Shin (hesitant): "We don’t know enough about them yet. What if it’s a trap?" 

Emi (firm): "I don’t care. We need to stop this now." 

Outcome: Shin and Emi leave the archives, heading toward the last place the Sato family was seen. They enter a dangerous situation, encountering strange figures that may or may not be human. 

**ARCHIVE BASEMENT - NIGHT**

If Shin and Emi choose to continue searching the archives, they stumble across a locked basement door. The air around it feels heavier, as if something is waiting beneath. 

Shin (curious): "There’s something down here. Should we check it out?" 

Emi (hesitant): "I don’t know, Shin. This place feels... wrong." 

The door creaks open, revealing a set of stone stairs leading into darkness. 

Player Choice: Should they enter the basement? 

**a. Enter the basement to uncover the truth.** 

Shin leads the way down, flashlight in hand, illuminating old texts and carvings on the walls. 

Shin: "This looks ancient. These carvings... they might be about the Shadows." 

Outcome: At the bottom of the stairs, they find an old chest filled with forgotten relics and a scroll detailing a ritual to banish the Shadows. 

**b. Decide to stay upstairs and continue searching the main archive.** 

Emi pulls Shin back from the stairs, her fear overtaking her curiosity. 

Emi: "No, Shin. Let’s not go down there. We should stick to what we know."

Outcome: They leave the archives and find Daisuke sitting on a nearby bench, his expression grave. 

ARCHIVE ENCOUNTER - NIGHT 

When they enter the basement, as they finish reading the scroll, a strange sound echoes from the shadows. Shin raises his flashlight, revealing a figure standing in the corner of the room—identical to Emi.

Unknown Girl (calling after him): "Run all you want; you can’t escape what’s coming." 

Outcome: Shin manages to flee deeper into the forest, but now he’s lost, surrounded by the oppressive darkness. This leads to a survival sequence where Shin must navigate the forest while the unknown girl potentially pursues him. 

Unknown Girl: "You see, it doesn’t matter how fast or slow you are. What’s coming can’t be stopped." 

"You think you can save anyone? You’re too weak. You failed Emi, and now you’ll fail everyone else." 

"The island is cursed, Shin. You, Emi, the Sato family—you’re all just pawns in a game much older than you. The Shadows are already here. And 	they’re coming for you." 

**Mysterious Revelation** 

After the confrontation, Shin stumbles across something left behind by the unknown girl—an old, weathered photograph. In it, Emi stands next to a woman who looks just like the mysterious attacker. The caption on the back reads:

**STREET – DAY** 

Emi and Shin are walking side by side, catching their breath after the close encounter. 

Emi (with a sigh of relief): "Whew, that was close, huh?" 

Shin (looking concerned, staring at her blue school uniform): "Hey, Emi, are you okay? Has anything hurt?" 

The camera lingers on Emi, her blue uniform standing out. She's Nami's younger 	sister, still in high school. 

Emi (smiling, cheerful): "Oh, no, I’m alright. Thank you for worrying." (They continue walking towards Emi's house, the mood lightening as they talk.) 

Emi: "It’s been a long time since I saw you, though." (Shin nods silently, remembering the time that’s passed.) 

Scene 1: Arriving at the Funeral 

Shin and Emi reach the funeral site in the small coastal town of Sado. The warm, golden light of summer contrasts with the heavy atmosphere, as if the town itself is holding its breath. Something feels deeply unsettling to Shin. As they step inside, the murmurs of mourners mix with the sound of the ocean waves crashing in the distance. 

Shin catches glimpses of familiar faces, but something feels wrong. The events that took place in his dream are currently coming to life in the real world. 

Player Choice: What should Shin do? 

**a. Recall his dream about the past.**

Outcome: Ren was about to share what he knew about the Sato family. As they spoke, a sudden flash of light occurred, but no one was holding a camera. 

**THE FUNERAL CONTINUES**  

The funeral continues their cultural process. Shin’s wearing a plain polo shirt and black slacks. After the ritual, the priest called Shin to assist in lifting the coffin.  

Shin had a hint of what was going on, as if his dream had come true, but he didn't know if it was real or not. 

Fuji: “Shin, can you help us lift the coffin?” He asks a favor for Shin. 

Shin: “Sure, I’m coming over there.” 

Shin recalled noticing a mark on Nami's neck, prompting him to immediately look at it. 

Player choice: What does shin do? 

Just let it go because maybe it's just a coincidence. 

Shin talks to his mind: Maybe it’s just a coincidence. 

Outcome: He will first ensure that it was just a dream and the mark on Nami's neck was merely a coincidence. 

Investigate because what he had in his dream is true.

Kenji: What do you mean? You’re starting to freak me out shin. 

Outcome: Shin’s resolve strengthens, and he sets out on a solitary path, determined to face the darkness head-on. 

**Living Room Scene** 

As time passes by, the things he dreamed about are happening to the point that he can foresee what will happen next. 

Shin and Emi are in the kitchen, and Shin is cooking some ramen for dinner. Emi changed her clothes to comfy clothes, which are a tank top and mini shorts. 

Ren arrived in the living room. 

Ren: “It smells good. What is that? Is that ramen?” He asks while removing his 	coat and hat. 

“Ahh yes,” Shin proudly said. 

Ren: “So, you still know how to cook them; I remember that being Nami's favorite 	food”, He sadly said. 

Shin: Ahh, yes, I remember. She told me to cook one for her, but I'm too dumb, and I rejected her, He said disappointedly. “This is ready; let's eat," 

Shin takes four plates to show respect to Nami because he wants to give her 	ramen. 

Emi: “Ooh, you’re including Nami too,” 

Shin: “Ah yes, because I know that she would love this, especially since it's her 	request before I left the island.”  

While they were eating, Shin could not stop thinking about what Daisuke said about the shadows, "The shadows are part of the island's dark history." "They mimic people perfectly." "Be cautious, they are dangerous... they will try to deceive you." he said in his mind. He remembered that in his dream, they were killed by the “shadow” in the forest. He thinks that his dream is possible because what happened there seems to align with what he dreamed. 

Emi: "Shin, are you okay?". 

Player choice: What does shin reply? 

**a. Uh yes, I’m okay** 

Shin: I just thought of something, but it's not important. 

Outcome: They will eat

Outcome: Emi was confused by what was happening. 

Emi: I saw everything, I was there when the tragedy happened and my 	sister saved the boy, it was not on purpose. I saw that my sister drowned 	while she was saving him. 

**c. He will ask Emi there about what happened on the day of Nami's death.**  

Shin to Ren: Did you notice anything suspicious on the day Nami died? 

Outcome: (Emi thinking)  

Emi: Before the moment that happened, my sister told me that she had 	seen someone who looked exactly like her. But I said that maybe it was 	just her imagination, and she said that what she saw was true. 

**B1 HARUTO AND THE SHADOW ENCOUNTER (NIGHT)** 

Haruto, the only police officer in town, drives his police car through the quiet city streets to patrol. As he passes by a house, he spots Emi standing outside, and she is looking at the 2nd floor of their house while wearing her school uniform. 

Haruto: “Emi? What are you staring at your own house for?” Haruto pulled over, 	rolling down the window of his police car. 

Emi keeps on staring. 

Emi: “....” 

Haruto asks, “Are you okay, Emi?” 

But Emi just looked and smiled at him. 

As the day passed and everyone prepared for the next, the routine remained comforting. Shin, as always, assisted in running Ren's restaurant, ensuring everything flowed smoothly. The town seemed peaceful on the surface. 

Shin: "Uncle, can you cook Haruto's usual order?" 

Ren: "Why? Is Haruto here?" 

Shin: “No, but I have guts that he will arrive soon.” 

After a few minutes, the familiar chime of the bell announced his arrival. It was Haruto. He greeted everyone with a nod and made his way to the counter. 

Before Haruto could even speak, Shin walked towards Haruto at the counter holding Haruto’s usual order. 

Shin: “Hey Haruto, here’s your usual order.” He greeted him with a warm smile 	while putting his meal on the table. 

Haruto: “Ergh?!” confused. 

Haruto: “How? I wasn’t ordering yet!”  

Shin: “Hehe” he replied while scratching the back of his head.  

Now, Shin was certain that his dream was real. 

Player choice: What will happen next? 

**KAHIT ANONG PILIIN NILA MAGUGULAT PA DIN SI HARUTO DAHIL BINIGAY NI REN YUNG PAGKAIN KAHIT DI PA SYA UMOORDER**

When Shin gives Haruto's order, he is surprised because he hasn't said his order yet, but Shin gives it right away.   

Outcome: They will talk about the SATO family that until now there are no leads on their whereabouts. 

Shin tells Haruto that he wants to help find out who killed Nami. 

Shin talks to Haruto: I want to help find the person who killed her. I think I will be a great help. 

Outcome: Haruto disagrees with him. 

Haruto: No, you should leave it to the police to find Nami's killer. 

Shin greets Haruto 

Haruto: "Actually, Shin, I wanted to talk to you about something strange that's been going on around town.” He nodded but hesitated for a moment before speaking. 

Shin: Is there a lead on where the Sato family is? 

Outcome: Haruto was confused because before he could say what he was going 	to say, shin immediately preceded him 

**SHIN RECALLS WHAT HAPPENED IN HIS DREAMS** 

Shin is thinking……trying to recall the events that happened in his dream. Then suddenly, he remembered that Emi, Shin himself and a mysterious woman died in his dream.  

As time went by, Haruto could see that Shin was breaking out in a cold sweat, so he immediately asked him. 

Haruto: “Shin? What's on your mind? Are you okay?” 

Shin: “Yeah I’m okay, but hmm can I take a minute?” He replied immediately. 

Shin hurriedly went to Ren 

Shin: “Ren, can I take a break? I need to do something”

Shin: okay, I'll be right back, I just must do something

**B. Wait, Shin, we have many customers, and I need an assistant here.** 

Shin: But I really have to go, Ren. I promise I'll be back soon. 

Outcome: Shin arrived at the scene too late and found the mysterious girl already bleeding. 

**B1 FOREST SCENE** 

Shin arrived quickly and was curious about the woman's whereabouts. Suddenly, he heard a woman's voice shouting,  

Mysterious woman: "Run!" 

He looked in the direction from which the voice came and saw a girl running toward him. They then hid behind a huge tree. 

While they were in hiding, they heard the sound of the unknown girl getting closer. The mysterious girl raised her shotgun and aimed at the unknown girl, but only managed to graze her arm with the shot. 

The mysterious girl wanted to kill the unknown girl, but she thought that the boy would be a burden if he got hurt, so she decided that they both fled to a safer place. 

Mysterious girl: “What are you doing here?” 

**a. I am Shin Fujiwara** 

The mysterious girl shocked by what Shin said 

Outcome: The mysterious girl will be surprised by what Shin said, and she will 	feel the need to have a conversation with him to better understand his point.

**SHIN AND MYSTERIOUS GIRL MANAGED TO ESCAPE FROM THE SHADOW** 

Shin: “I am Shin, Shin Fujiwara,” Shin said while he is panting. 

The mysterious girl was shocked by what he said. 

Mysterious girl: “Shin Fujiwara???” she said in confusion. 

Shin: “Everything that happened in my dream came true. I know it may sound 		crazy, but that is the truth,” Shin explained. “The one who's going to kill you is a ‘shadow’, and that’s what we encountered before.” he added. 

Mysterious girl: "So, you know about the shadow as well. I believe what you're 	saying," The mysterious girl replied. "Tell me more about what you know from 	your dream." 

As they continued their conversation about his dream. 

**RESTAURANT SCENE** 

Ren wonders why Shin hasn't returned yet, so she asks Emi to look for him.  

Ren: "Emi, can you look for Shin? He has not returned since he left,"  

Player choice: What does Emi reply? 

**a. "Okay, I'll go now,"** 

As Emi walks, she thinks about where Shin might have gone.  

Outcome: She reaches the forest in search of Shin. While walking through the forest, she notices a girl entering. 

**Forest Scene Emi encounters her shadow** 

Emi: "Hey! Where are you going?!" She shouts.  

She follows the girl out of curiosity. As she searches for the girl, someone touches her shoulder. When she turns around, she's shocked to see that the girl looks exactly like her. 

Emi: "Wh- Who are you?" she asked, her voice trembling with fear. 

Emi saw that she was about to be stabbed, and immediately screamed. Shin and Amaya heard the scream, so Amaya quickly handed a knife to Shin and they rushed to where they heard the scream. 

Amaya and Shin were panting as they ran to find the girl. 

When they reached where the scream came from, Shin was shocked when he saw Emi lying on the ground, bleeding heavily and weak.  

Shin:"Emi, no!" He shouted with a trembling voice. 

Bagangggg!#%@ The loud noise from the shotgun as it fired 

Amaya quickly took action, firing her gun at the shadow that looked just like Emi. The shadow dodged, and she and Shin rushed to Emi, who was lying on the ground. 

Shin: "Emi... Emiii... wake up," Shin called out. 

Emi: "Who is that? Why does it look like me?" Emi asked weakly. 

Player choice: What does Shin reply? 

**a. "Shh, it's okay, Emi. We will save you no matter what. I promise,"** 

Outcome: Shin positioned Emi to lean against a nearby tree for support and then turned to Amaya. 

**b. Amaya, I need to take Emi to the hospital.**

**c. Outcome: Shin picks up Emi to run and get her out of the forest.** 

Shin: "Wait for me, Emi. I need to help Amaya."

Shin grabbed the knife Amaya had given him and sprinted towards her to help. Bang! Cluck! Bang! Cluck! Bang! The sound of Amaya's gunshots echoed. She realized her bullets were running out; she had only two left. 

Amaya: "Shin, I only have two bullets left," Amaya shouted, blood dripping from her left hand. 

They didn't notice the shadow heading closer to Emi. Amaya shot at it, but the shadow avoided it. 

Bang! A shotgun sounds like this. 

Amaya: "Damn it! I missed!" Amaya muttered, frustration in her voice. 

Shin Shouts 

Shin: "Emiiiiiii!" Shin shouts  

Shluk! 

Shin and Amaya froze, their eyes widening in terror as they witnessed the shadow stabbed Emi without hesitation. 

Shin charged towards the shadow; his face altered in hatred. 

Shin: "Emi, no!" 

he shouted, his voice trembling with rage as he rushed for the shadow holding a knife. 

Shin: "Don't die, Emi! I will save you; hold on!" Shin said. 

Shik! Swoosh! Shik! Swoosh! 

Player choice: What will come next? 

**a. Stab the shadow**

Shin tried to stab the shadow, but it kept evading him. He noticed Amaya was weakening, and Emi was unconscious, motionless. It was as if the shadow was toying with him. 

Outcome: 

Shin: "Waaaahhhhhhhh..." Shin let out a desperate cry. As he attempted to strike again, the shadow moved faster and stabbed him in the arm. 

**b. He will sacrifice himself for Emi.**   

Shin will sacrifice himself for Emi; that's why the shadow stabs Shin three times, causing his blood to leak out, and he just lies next to Emi. 

Outcome: Shin will die from blood lost 

Shin: "Ahh!"  

Shin collapsed to his knees, pain tearing through his body. 

Shin's thoughts raced as he breathed deeply.  He was unsure if Emi was still alive, lost in a whirlwind of thoughts about how to save her. 

Until... It suddenly hit him. His dream was not only a dream. He knew he could travel back in time, but he had no idea how or whether it was possible. 

The shadow moved closer to Amaya, preparing to kill her next. 

Shin: "Damn it! How do I go back to the past?" Shin wondered desperately. 

The shadow was about to kill Amaya when Shin yelled,  

AMAYA, THROW ME THE GUN! 

Both the shadow and Amaya stopped being taken by surprise. 

Amaya: "It's too late! We can't kill it with just this last bullet!" Amaya said, her voice weakening and her body covered in blood. 

Shin: "Trust me! Throw me the gun!" Shin's voice was determined and persistent. 

Amaya threw the gun to Shin. 

Kishk!! (Gun Sound) 


The shadow smirked, certain that it was capable of avoiding Shin's final bullet. But when Shin did not point the gun at the shadow, its confident expression instantly changed to confusion, as did Amaya's. Instead, he pointed to his own head. 

Amaya: "What are you doing, Shin? Don't give up hope! Don't kill yourself!" Amaya said, her voice filled with fear. 

Shin was panting heavily. 

Shin: "Trust me. I'll be back. I'll save you and Emi," he said his eyes filled with terror as he struggled with his own words. 

Amaya stared at him, confused by his actions. 

Shin: "I promise, I'll come back and save you!" Shin added, tears flowing down his face. 

Bang! The gun went off. 

Suddenly, everything went dark.
