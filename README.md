## First Chapter

Shin Tachibana is a high school student who left Sado Island years ago, hoping for the city's excitement, bright lights, and endless possibilities. But when he received news of Nami's death, something pulled him back. He couldn’t understand it—a sense of duty, maybe—or the gnawing guilt that he had left behind those he cared about most. Nami is a high school student who has been his best friend, the girl who dared him to explore the darkest caves, who laughed with him under the summer stars, and who has been there for him when no one else was. 

Shin woke up on a boat, where his eyes wandered around, and he checked his phone. He saw his childhood friend Nami on the boat. Nami’s dressed in a plain white summer dress.  

**A QUIET STREET – DAY** 

Scene 1: The Encounter 

Shin is shocked at why he's falling and shouting Nami's name. After that, Shin woke up while shouting Nami's name. The mysterious girl next to him was shocked to hear his voice. 

Shin: "Nami!" 

(His voice echoes in the quiet street. He sits up, disoriented, scanning his surroundings. Nearby, a mysterious girl watches him, startled.) 

Shin: "I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to shout..." 

(He scratches the back of his head, clearly embarrassed. The girl remains silent but curious, watching Shin.) 

Shin pauses and looks at the girl more closely. 

Player Choice: What does Shin do next? 

**1. Ask the girl if she knows Nami.** 

Shin: "Hey, do you know someone named Nami? I feel like I was just... dreaming about her."  

The girl shakes her head, looking confused. 

Outcome: 

Mysterious Girl: "Nami? I don’t know anyone by that name. Are you sure it wasn’t just a dream?" 

Shin feels a wave of uncertainty. Did he imagine it or is there more to this memory 	than he realizes? This outcome leaves Shin doubting his own memories, creating a path where he must question reality. It triggers a quest where he investigates whether Nami is connected to the strange events on the island, uncovering a hidden part of her past that could link to the Shadows. 

**2. Apologize again for the outburst.** 

Shin: "Sorry for shouting. I didn’t mean to scare you." 

The girl smiles faintly and nods in acknowledgment, still staying quiet. 

Outcome: 

Mysterious Girl: "It’s okay. I was just worried about you." 

This interaction builds trust between Shin and the girl. She begins to open about her own concerns, and they discuss the strange occurrences on the island. This choice leads to a path where the girl becomes a potential ally, helping Shin as they search for answers. Shin and the girl decide to explore together, pooling their knowledge about the island’s mysteries. 

**3. Try to remember the dream he just had.** 

Shin: "What was I dreaming about...? There was Nami, and then... something else..." 

He rubs his temples, but the memory of the dream slips away like mist. 

Outcome: 

Despite his efforts, Shin can’t recall the details of the dream. However, he is left with a lingering sense of dread, as if the dream was trying to warn him of something. This path leads Shin to focus more on his intuition and feelings. He senses that the dream holds vital clues about the island’s curse, urging him to dive deeper into his own subconscious. Shin will need to meditate or use another method to recover fragments of the dream. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scene 2: Arriving on Sado Island 

Shin and Emi arrive at the shores of Sado Island, the salty air mingling with the cool breeze as they step off the ship. The peaceful surroundings are quickly overshadowed by a sense of unease. Emi, her face brightening upon seeing Shin in the distance, runs toward him in excitement. But in her rush, she fails to notice a car speeding down the road toward her. 

Shin: "Emi!" (Before he can react, the car barrels toward her, brakes screeching.) 

Player Choice: What should Shin do? 

**1. Yell at Emi to stop.** 

Shin: "Emi, stop!" (Emi freezes mid-step, confusion flashing in her eyes. The car swerves, narrowly missing her. She turns to Shin, shaken.) 

Outcome: 
Emi feels embarrassed and guilty, slightly straining their relationship. She then reveals that she thought she saw someone familiar, adding an element of mystery. 

 **2. Run and grab Emi before she reaches the street.** 

Shin: (Without hesitation, Shin rushes forward, grabbing Emi’s arm and pulling her back just as the car screeches past. They tumble to the ground, hearts pounding.) 

Outcome: 
This strengthens their bond, with Emi feeling more trust toward Shin, though still shaken by the close call. 

 **3. Stand back and let the driver handle it.** 

Shin hesitates, watching as the car comes to a screeching halt just inches from Emi. The driver honks in frustration before speeding away. 

Outcome: 
Emi becomes upset, feeling that Shin didn’t step up to protect her. Tension rises between them, leading to a sense of mistrust. 

**STREET – DAY** 

Emi and Shin are walking side by side, catching their breath after the close encounter. 

Emi (with a sigh of relief): "Whew, that was close, huh?" 

Shin (looking concerned, staring at her blue school uniform): "Hey, Emi, are you okay? Has anything hurt?" 

The camera lingers on Emi, her blue uniform standing out. She's Nami's younger 	sister, still in high school. 

Emi (smiling, cheerful): "Oh, no, I’m alright. Thank you for worrying." (They continue walking towards Emi's house, the mood lightening as they talk.) 

Emi: "It’s been a long time since I saw you, though." (Shin nods silently, remembering the time that’s passed.) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scene 1: Arriving at the Funeral 

Shin and Emi reach the funeral site in the small coastal town of Sado. The warm, golden light of summer contrasts with the heavy atmosphere, as if the town itself is holding its breath. Something feels deeply unsettling to Shin. As they step inside, the murmurs of mourners mix with the sound of the ocean waves crashing in the distance. 

Shin catches glimpses of familiar faces, but something feels wrong. Nami’s death feels unnatural. He recalls the mysterious shadows he saw in the days before her death. 

Player Choice: What should Shin do? 

**1. Look around the mourners for suspicious behavior.**

Shin glances around at the mourners. Their faces are sorrowful, but something feels off... He sees one man standing away from the crowd, staring at him intensely. 

Shin (thinking): "Who is that? And why is he watching me?" (The man turns and vanishes into the crowd. 

Outcome: The man Shin noticed disappears into the crowd, increasing Shin’s suspicion. This moment plants a seed of doubt in Shin's mind, making him more paranoid about the people around him. He will now start questioning the intentions of others, leading to potential trust issues. 

**2. Recall his dream about the past.** 

Shin (thinking): "Nami... and my parents... why do I feel like this all started 	10 years ago?" (He closes his eyes, remembering the day Nami’s family 	took him in after his parents' tragic accident. A sense of dread washes 	over him.) 

Outcome: Shin is overwhelmed by a deep sense of dread, as his memories of Nami and the tragic death of his parents resurface. He starts to believe the current events might be connected to his past, pushing him to dig deeper into his family’s history. 

**3. Approach Nami’s family to offer his condolences.** 

Shin: "I’m so sorry for your loss." 

Outcome: Nami's family graciously accepts Shin's condolences, but their grief-stricken faces make it clear they are hiding deeper pain. This interaction builds Shin’s empathy, but he senses they may not be telling him everything about Nami’s death.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scene 2: At the funeral 

The funeral progresses, and Shin feels a growing unease. He stands quietly at the back, watching the ceremony. The familiar surroundings feel distorted, as though reality itself is slipping. The faces of the mourners blur together. 

Player Choice: What does Shin think about? 

**1. The mysterious shadows he saw before Nami’s death.**

Shin (thinking): "I saw something that night... shadows... but no one believes me. Could they have something to do with what happened to Nami?" (The memory of those dark figures sends a chill down his spine.) 

Outcome: 
	A sense of dread builds, and Shin starts suspecting a supernatural cause behind Nami's death. 

**2. His connection to Nami’s family.**

Shin (thinking): "This family... they saved me when I lost everything. Nami was more than a friend; she was like my sister." (He clenches his fist, feeling the weight of the past.) 

Outcome:  
His loyalty deepens, and Shin becomes emotionally attached to solving the mystery, feeling that he owes it to both Nami and her family. 

**3. A strange feeling that Nami’s death isn’t the end of something, but the beginning.** 

Shin (thinking): "This doesn’t feel right... Nami’s death feels like the start of something darker. What’s happening on this island?" (His heart races as he begins to sense a deeper mystery surrounding her death.) 

Outcome: 
A darker realization dawns, and Shin becomes obsessed with unraveling what might be a larger conspiracy or sinister force affecting the island. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene 3: Unveiling the past 

After the funeral service, Shin stands outside, staring at the ocean. The waves crash rhythmically, but his mind is far from calm. A chilling realization begins to surface. 

Player Choice: How does Shin feel about Nami’s death? 

**1. Suspicious.** 

Shin (thinking): "There’s no way this was just an accident. I need to find out what really happened." (He feels a sense of determination building within him.) 

Outcome:  
A resolve to investigate pushes Shin to search for clues and question everyone who might know more about what happened. 

**2. Grief-stricken.** 

Shin (thinking): "I can’t believe she’s gone... and I couldn’t do anything to stop it." (His eyes well up, the pain of losing Nami overwhelming him.) 

Outcome: 
His emotions lead him astray, but the pain pushes him forward to search for answers, even if he’s not sure what he’ll find. 

**3. Confused.** 

Shin (thinking): "I don’t understand... but something about this funeral, about the island, feels... wrong." (His thoughts swirl in confusion, unsure where to begin unraveling the mystery.) 

Outcome:  
His confusion leads to curiosity, compelling him to slowly piece together the fragments of an unsettling mystery. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REN'S LIVING ROOM – DAY 

Shin stands across from Ren, Nami and Emi's father. The room is filled with mourners, but their conversation feels private and tense. 

Shin (softly, hesitant): "I’m sorry for your loss. Nami was... she was like a sister to me." 

Ren (wiping his tears, his voice breaking): "Thank you, Shin. She always spoke fondly of you. It’s just... I still can’t believe she’s gone." 

Shin (pauses, then carefully asks): "I’ve been thinking about what happened. Do you think there was anything unusual before...?" 

Ren (confused): "Unusual? No, she was her usual self. But, Shin, why would you ask that?" 

Shin (glancing around, lowering his voice): "I don’t know. It’s just this feeling I have. Like there’s something we’re missing, something we’re not seeing." 

Ren (nervously): "What do you mean, Shin? This was just a tragic accident, right?" 

Shin (somber, unsure): "I hope so. But... I can’t shake the feeling that something’s wrong on this island. Something is not natural." 

Ren (fear creeping in): "Shin, what are you saying?" 

Shin: "I don’t know yet, but I’m going to find out. I owe it to Nami to uncover the truth." 

Ren wipes his eyes again and walks over to speak with other visitors, leaving Shin alone with his thoughts. The sounds of murmurs from the crowd fill the room. 

As Shin stands lost in thought, two voices murmur nearby. 
Unknown Person 1 (whispering): "Is that Shin?" 

Unknown Person 2: "Ah, yes. He must be the one who’s suffering because he lost his best friend." 

Unknown Person 1: "But hey, didn’t you know they did an autopsy on Nami’s body? The results say it was just an accident." 

Unknown Person 2: "Aw, that’s sad to hear." 

Shin hears their whispers and glances out the window, lost in thought. Suddenly, he feels arms wrap around his back. He turns to see his friend, Kenji, dressed in a white polo and black slacks, tears in his eyes. 

Kenji (sobbing, emotional): "Shin! It’s been a long time; where have you been?!" 

Shin (managing a small smile): "Kenji! You really dressed up for this, huh?" 

(Shin glances at Kenji’s white polo and black slacks.) 

Kenji (shrugging somberly): "Yeah, I figured it’s the least I could do for Nami. She deserves our respect, you know?" 

Shin (nodding, his expression darkening): "Yeah, she did. It’s just... hard to wrap my head around all this." 

Kenji (confused): "Are you okay, Shin? You seem off. More than usual." 

Shin (sighs, looking out the window again): "I’m just trying to make sense of everything. Something doesn’t feel right about all this." 

Kenji (placing a reassuring hand on Shin’s shoulder): "Hey, whatever it is, we’ll figure it out together. Nami was our friend too." 

While Shin and Kenji talk, suddenly a flash of light catches Shin’s eye. He turns around quickly, feeling startled. The flash had come from behind him, like a camera flash, but there’s no one holding a camera. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player Choice: What does Shin do? 

**1. Approach the little boy who’s staring at him.** 

Shin notices a young boy standing still in the corner, staring at him intently. 		Something about the boy feels off. 

Shin (quietly to himself): "Who is that kid? Why is he staring at me like that?" 

Shin (walking toward the boy): "Hey, were you taking pictures?" (The boy doesn’t answer, his expression blank.) 

Outcome: 
A deeper sense of unease sets in, and Shin becomes more certain that something supernatural is afoot, possibly connected to the boy. 

**2. Look around the room for the source of the flash.**

Shin quickly scans the room, his heart pounding. There’s no camera, no one taking photos. The flash of light seems to have disappeared as quickly as it appeared. 

Shin (thinking): "What the hell was that? Am I imagining things?" 

Outcome: 
A creeping paranoia begins to affect Shin’s perceptions, making him question his own sanity as strange events continue to unfold. 

**3. Ask Kenji if he saw the flash.** 

Shin (turning to Kenji): "Hey, did you see that flash just now?" 

Kenji (confused): "Flash? I didn’t see anything. Are you sure you’re alright, Shin?" Shin frowns, unsure of what he just experienced. 

Shin (thinking): "Was I the only one who saw it?" 

Outcome: 
Isolation increases, as Shin begins to wonder if he’s the only one who can see the truth, or if he’s losing his grip on reality. 

Regardless of the choice, Shin feels an increasing sense of unease. The little boy continues to watch him, expressionless. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player Choice: How does Shin respond to the growing mystery? 

**1. Decide to investigate further on his own.** 

Shin takes a deep breath, making a silent decision to investigate the strange occurrences on the island, starting with Nami’s death. 

Shin (thinking): "I’ll find out what’s really going on, even if no one else believes me." 

Outcome: 
Shin’s resolve strengthens, and he sets out on a solitary path, determined to face the darkness head-on. 

**2. Tell Kenji about the feeling that something’s wrong.**

Shin (to Kenji): "I don’t think this was just an accident, Kenji. Something’s not right on this island." 

Kenji (concerned): "What do you mean? You’re starting to freak me out, Shin." 

Outcome: 
Shin’s resolve strengthens, and he sets out on a solitary path, determined to face the darkness head-on. 

**3. Confront the boy directly about what he saw.** 

Shin (stepping closer to the boy): "Did you see something just now? What are you looking at?" 

The boy’s expression doesn’t change. Instead, he quietly turns and walks away, leaving Shin more confused than ever. 

Outcome: 
The boy's cryptic behavior deepens the mystery, leaving Shin even more confused and desperate for answers as the boy walks away without a word. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FUNERAL HALL - DAY 

Shin stands in the corner of the room, staring blankly at the crowd, lost in thought. 

Shin (thinking to himself): "What was that flash?" 

His eyes shift towards a young boy standing in the distance. 

Shin (whispering to Kenji): "Who is that young boy?" 

Kenji (whispering back): "Ahh, that’s Lekra. His family owns a small convenience store on the island. He’s the child Nami rescued in the sea." 

Kenji leans in closer, his voice lower. 

Kenji: "My dad and the police did an autopsy on Nami’s body... and there’s a suspicious mark on her neck." 

Shin (shocked): "What?! Does anyone know about it?" 

Kenji (in a hushed tone): "Only you, the police, my father, and me. The police ruled it as an accident because no one was around when Nami saved the drowning kid." 

Shin (stunned): "What...?" 

Kenji: "Let’s talk about it later. I’ll call you." 

Their conversation is cut short as the funeral continues with cultural rituals. The priest stands near the coffin, chanting softly as the ceremony progresses. Mourners bow their heads in respect. 

Fuji, a family friend, approaches Shin quietly. 

Fuji: "Shin, can you help us lift the coffin?" 

Shin (nodding): "Sure, I’m coming." 

Shin and a few others carefully lift the coffin, placing it into the back of the car that will transport Nami’s body. As the weight of the coffin presses on Shin, so does the weight of his growing suspicion. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player Choice: How does Shin react to Kenji’s revelation? 

**1. Decide to investigate the suspicious mark on Nami’s neck after the funeral.** 

Shin makes a silent vow to investigate what really happened to Nami. Something about the mark feels important, like a clue to her mysterious death. 

Shin (thinking): "I need to find out what caused that mark. Maybe Lekra knows something." 

Outcome: 
Shin’s resolve to uncover the truth strengthens. He decides to start by finding out what caused the mark, hoping it will lead him to the answers surrounding Nami’s mysterious death. His determination becomes the driving force behind his actions. 

**2. Ask Lekra directly about the day Nami rescued him.** 

Shin glances over at Lekra, the young boy who Nami saved from drowning. Something about the boy’s presence feels strange, almost haunting. 

Shin (thinking): "I should talk to him, see if he remembers anything." (Shin approaches Lekra after the ceremony.) 

Shin (gently): "Hey, Lekra. I wanted to ask you about the day Nami saved you. Do you remember anything unusual?" 

Outcome: 
Lekra’s cryptic responses and distant demeanor make Shin uneasy, but they also raise more questions. Did Lekra see something? This conversation plants the seed of suspicion in Shin’s mind about the boy, urging him to investigate further. 

**3. Confront the police about why they ruled Nami’s death an accident.** 

Shin decides that he won’t let this mystery rest. He’s going to the police to find out why they ruled Nami’s death an accident despite the suspicious mark on her neck. 

Shin (thinking): "There’s no way I’m letting this go. The police need to give me some answers." 

Outcome: 
The police are dismissive, frustrating Shin further. However, they drop a few hints that make Shin realize they may be hiding more than they’re saying. This confrontation only deepens his suspicion and pushes him to dig into the official reports, convinced there’s a cover-up involved. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scene Transition: After the Funeral 

As the car pulls away with Nami’s coffin, Shin stands at the edge of the funeral hall, staring after it. The sun begins to set, casting long shadows across the ground. The atmosphere feels thick with unanswered questions. 

Player Choice: What does Shin do next? 

**1. Meet up with Kenji to discuss the autopsy results further.** 

Later that evening, Shin meets Kenji to talk in private. Kenji looks tense, glancing over his shoulder as they sit down. 

Kenji: "Shin, I didn’t tell you everything earlier. There’s something else..."(Kenji pulls out a small notebook, flipping to a page with a sketch of the mark on Nami’s neck.) 

Outcome: 
Kenji’s revelation about the mark deepens Shin’s suspicion. There’s something abnormal about it, something that doesn’t fit with a simple accident. Kenji’s unease convinces Shin that they’re on the verge of uncovering something dangerous. 

**2. Follow Lekra to his family’s convenience store to question him.** 

Shin follows Lekra discreetly as he walks back towards the convenience store. The boy seems unaware of Shin’s presence. Something about the boy’s quiet demeanor unsettles Shin. 

Shin (thinking): "I need to know what he saw that day. There’s more to this story." 

Outcome: 
Lekra’s reaction is unsettling. His avoidance and cryptic responses only heighten Shin’s suspicion that he knows more than he’s letting on. As Shin leaves the store, he’s convinced that something traumatic happened during the rescue, and Lekra is hiding it. 

**3. Investigate the area where Nami saved Lekra from drowning.** 

Shin heads to the beach where Nami saved Lekra. The waves crash against the shore, but the place feels ominous. Shin walks along the edge of the water, looking for clues. 

Shin (thinking): "If something happened here, there must be some kind of evidence." 

Outcome: 
Shin discovers subtle but telling clues—disturbed sand, broken branches, and something shiny in the water. These minor details convince him that Nami’s death wasn’t an accident and that the beach holds secrets waiting to be uncovered. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 

Shin is in the kitchen, finishing up the ramen as Emi enters, now dressed casually. The atmosphere is warm but underlined with sadness. 

Emi (excitedly): "Hmmm, it smells so good. What are you cooking, Shin?" 

Shin (smiling softly): "I’m cooking ramen." 

Emi (grinning): "Oh, I see." 

Just then, Ren enters the living room, removing his coat and hat, the smell of ramen filling the air. 

Ren (sighing softly): "It smells good. What is that? Ramen?" 

Shin (proudly): "Yeah, it’s ramen." 

Ren’s expression darkens slightly as he walks closer. 

Ren (sadly): "So, you still know how to cook it... I remember it was Nami’s favorite." 

Shin’s smile fades as he recalls a painful memory. 

Shin (disappointed): "Yeah... she once asked me to make it for her, but I was too stubborn and said no. I regret that now." 

Shin finishes serving the ramen, placing the bowls on the table. Emi grabs an extra plate and places it down. 

Ren (noticing): "Ooh, you’re including Nami too." 

Emi (softly smiling): "Yeah... I just thought she should have a place at the table. She would’ve loved this, especially since Shin made it." 

They eat quietly, the air heavy with unspoken thoughts. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Player Choice: How does Shin handle the memory of Nami during dinner? 

**1. Stay quiet and eat, holding back his emotions.**

Shin quietly eats his ramen, the weight of regret sitting heavily in his chest. He doesn’t want to ruin the moment, but the silence between them feels louder than words. 

Outcome: 
The dinner passes in heavy silence, with Shin quietly internalizing his grief. Although Ren and Emi sense his pain, they don’t press him. The atmosphere grows somber, as the unspoken bond of shared loss hangs over them. Shin feels the quiet isolation of his own regrets deepening. 

**2. Open about a fond memory with Nami.**

Shin (softly, trying to lighten the mood): "I remember the time Nami made ramen for me when I was feeling down. She burned the noodles, but it was still the best meal I’ve ever had." The group smiles faintly, the bittersweet memory hanging in the air. 

Outcome: 
Emi’s behavior unsettles Haruto. She remains frozen, as if waiting for something to happen. After several minutes, Haruto can’t shake the eerie feeling that something is wrong. He decides to intervene, stepping out of his car. As he walks toward her, the sense of foreboding grows, and he wonders if she’s truly alone outside.  

The instinct kicking in as he senses there might be something more to her words. The tension between them grows as they both contemplate what she saw.

**3. Express regret about never making ramen for Nami when she asked.**

Shin (sighing deeply): "I still regret not making ramen for her when she asked. If I had known..." 

Ren (nodding): "We all have regrets, Shin. But she knew you cared." 

Outcome: 
Ren and Emi smile faintly at the memory, their hearts warmed by Shin’s recollection. The air lightens slightly as they share a bittersweet moment of connection through their memories of Nami. Although the pain remains, the shared story brings a sense of healing. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CITY STREETS - NIGHT 

It’s now 10 PM, and the streets are quiet due to the curfew. Haruto, dressed in his washed blue police uniform, drives his patrol car through the deserted streets. As he passes by a familiar house, he spots something unusual. 

He slows down as he notices Emi standing outside her house, wearing her school uniform, staring up at the second floor. 

Haruto (thinking): "What is she doing outside this late?" 

Player Choice: How does Haruto handle see Emi outside during curfew? 

**1. Stop and talk to Emi, asking her what she’s doing outside.**

Haruto pulls over and steps out of the car. Walking up to her quietly, he calls her 	name. 

Haruto (gently): "Emi? It’s curfew. What are you doing out here?" 

Emi (still looking at the second floor, almost in a daze): "I... thought I saw someone in the window..." 

Outcome: 
Ren’s words offer Shin some comfort, but the regret lingers. The moment feels heavy, but it also allows Ren, Emi, and Shin to confront their shared sense of loss. The weight of unspoken guilt begins to lift slightly, but Shin is left with a renewed resolve to honor Nami’s memory by seeking the truth behind her death. 


**2. Observe her from a distance to see what she does next.**

Haruto decides not to approach Emi right away, choosing instead to observe her from his car. She continues to stare up at the window, unmoving. 

Haruto (thinking): "Why is she just standing there? Something feels off..." 

Outcome: 
Emi’s behavior unsettles Haruto. She remains frozen, as if waiting for something to happen. After several minutes, Haruto can’t shake the eerie feeling that something is wrong. He decides to intervene, stepping out of his car. As he walks toward her, the sense of foreboding grows, and he wonders if she’s truly alone outside.  

The instinct kicking in as he senses there might be something more to her words. The tension between them grows as they both contemplate what she saw. 

**3. Call out to her from the car, reminding her about the curfew.** 

Haruto lowers the window of his car and calls out to Emi from a distance. 

Haruto: "Emi, it’s curfew. You should head back inside." 

Emi doesn’t react immediately, but after a moment, she slowly turns to look at him, her expression distant. 

Emi (softly): "I thought I saw Nami." 

Outcome: 
Haruto feels a shiver run through him at the mention of Nami. The look on Emi’s face unsettles him, and he can’t shake the feeling that something unnatural is happening. He urges her to go inside, but the image of her standing alone in the dark stays with him, lingering like an unsolved mystery. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Player Choice: What does Haruto do after Emi mentions Nami? 

**1. Get out of the car and check the house with her.**

Haruto gets out of the car and approaches her cautiously. 

Haruto: "You saw Nami? Let’s look inside. I’ll come with you." They both head towards the house together, the atmosphere growing tense. 

Outcome: 
The house feels unnaturally still as they enter. Haruto can’t shake the eerie sensation that they aren’t alone. As they walk through the rooms, Haruto becomes increasingly convinced that something is watching them. His protective instinct kicks in, but a part of him wonders if Nami’s presence still lingers in the house. 

**2. Tell her to go inside and not to think about it.**

Haruto (sternly): "Emi, it’s late. You’re probably just imagining things. Go inside and get some rest." Emi hesitates, glancing back at the window before slowly walking back inside. 

Outcome: 
Haruto watches her go, but a sense of unease remains. Something about the way she mentioned Nami feels too real to be a simple delusion. As he drives away, he can’t shake the feeling that Emi is seeing more than just shadows. His mind is filled with unanswered questions as he continues his patrol. 

**3. Ask her if she’s been having any strange dreams or seeing things lately.** 

Haruto (lowering his voice): "Emi, have you been... seeing things lately? Dreams or strange shadows?" 

Emi (whispering): "Sometimes... but I thought it was just in my head. But this time, I’m sure I saw her, Haruto." 

Outcome: 
Haruto’s concern deepens as Emi admits to seeing things. The possibility that Nami’s death is linked to something supernatural begins to creep into his thoughts. He decides to keep a closer watch on Emi and the house, convinced that the mystery surrounding Nami’s death may be far darker than he initially thought. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 

The dimly lit street adds a sense of eeriness to the scene. Emi stands frozen outside her home, staring silently at the house’s second floor. Haruto, the town's only police officer, pulls up in his patrol car. He watches her for a moment, sensing something is wrong before rolling down his window. 

Haruto (concerned): "Emi? What are you doing out here this late? What are you staring at your own house for?" 

Emi remains silent, her gaze fixed on the house. The quiet is unsettling. Haruto steps out of the car, his police uniform catching the faint glow from the streetlights. He approaches Emi, his concern growing. 

Haruto (gently): "Are you okay, Emi?" 

Emi slowly turns her head towards Haruto, a strange, almost eerie smile forming on her face. She says nothing, just continues to smile at him, which only deepens the mystery. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player Choice: How does Haruto respond to Emi’s strange behavior? 

**1. Press Emi further, demanding to know what’s wrong.**

Haruto steps closer, his voice more firm but still gentle. 

Haruto: "Emi, this isn’t like you. Tell me what’s going on." 

Outcome: 

Emi’s smile fades, and she finally speaks in a low voice. 

Emi (whispering): "I... saw something. Something on the second floor." Haruto glances up at the house but sees nothing. The tension between them grows, and the scene leaves them uneasy, setting up more mystery about what Emi might have witnessed. 

**2. Try to lighten the mood and joke about her staring at the house.**

Haruto smiles faintly, trying to break the tension. 

Haruto (teasingly): "What, did your house grow bigger overnight?" 

Outcome: 
Emi lets out a small, forced laugh, but her eyes remain distant. 

Emi (softly): "It’s nothing... I was just... lost in thought." Haruto senses something is still wrong, but he decides not to push further. The uneasy tension lingers as Emi walks back inside, and Haruto is left feeling unsettled. 

**3. Offer to check the house for her.**

Haruto gives her a reassuring nod. 

Haruto: "Why don’t I go look?" Just to make sure everything’s okay." 

Outcome: 
Emi hesitates, then nods silently. Haruto walks towards the house, entering cautiously. Inside, the atmosphere feels thick with tension. He checks the second floor but finds nothing unusual. However, as he returns, he notices a strange shadow on the wall, only for it to vanish when he looks closer. Haruto now feels drawn into the same mystery that’s haunting Emi. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REN'S RESTAURANT - DAY 

The next day is business as usual in the small coastal town of Sado. Shin, as always, is busy assisting Ren with the restaurant. The peaceful routine of the town seems comforting on the surface, but there’s a growing sense of unease. Haruto, still shaken by the previous night’s encounter, enters the restaurant. 

The chime of the door announces his arrival, and the cozy atmosphere momentarily softens his usual serious demeanor. Ren greets Haruto with a nod, and Shin looks up from his work behind the counter. 

Haruto (nodding): "Morning." 

He makes his way to the counter and takes a seat. Shin pours him a cup of tea, noticing the tension on Haruto's face. 

Shin (curious): "You seem off. Everything okay?" 

Haruto takes a sip of tea, thinking about the strange encounter with Emi the night before. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player Choice: How does Haruto approach the subject with Shin and Ren? 

**1. Confide in Shin about Emi’s strange behavior last night.**

Haruto (quietly): "Shin, something strange happened last night. I found 	Emi outside, staring at her house like she’d seen a ghost." 

Outcome: 
Shin frowns, his own sense of unease deepening. 

Shin (nodding): "That doesn’t sound like her. Did she say anything?" Haruto shakes his head, feeling unsettled by the memory. This moment deepens the mystery surrounding Nami’s death and Emi’s behavior, making Shin even more determined to investigate what’s happening on the island. 

**2. Keep it to himself and focus on his patrol duties.**

Haruto (shaking his head): "Nah, just tired from last night’s patrol." 

Outcome: 
Haruto keeps the strange incident to himself, but the lingering discomfort remains. He continues with his day, but the feeling that something is wrong on the island grows stronger, creating tension that will come back to haunt him later. 

**3. Ask Ren if he’s noticed anything strange with Emi lately.**

Haruto (serious): "Ren, has Emi been acting differently? I saw her outside late last night, staring at your house. It was... strange." 

Outcome: 
Ren pauses, looking concerned. 

Ren: "She’s been quiet since Nami’s death. I thought it was just grief, but maybe... maybe it’s something more.” 

(This conversation opens a new layer of mystery, as Ren and Haruto now share a growing concern about Emi’s behavior. The tension in the story thickens, as they realize something more sinister may be at play.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUIET STREET – DAY 

Shin and Emi Walk with determination toward the Sato family home, their minds racing with thoughts of the strange disappearance. As they approach the house, the eerie silence is interrupted by the slow, deliberate footsteps of an older man. Daisuke, the island’s grizzled hunter, emerges from a nearby alley, his rifle slung over his back. His weathered face and sharp eyes suggest a lifetime of survival in the harshest conditions. 

Daisuke (gruff but intrigued): "You two seem in quite a hurry. What’s got you all worked up?" 

Shin and Emi turn to face him, both surprised by his sudden appearance. 

Shin (curious, but wary): "Daisuke... it’s the Sato family. They’ve disappeared." 

Daisuke narrows his eyes, his expression unreadable. 

Daisuke (quiet, but serious): "The Satos, you say? Well, that’s troubling. Disappearing folks aren't new on this island, you know." 

Emi steps forward, her voice filled with urgency. 

Emi (anxious): "Do you know anything about it? Please, Daisuke, if you know something, tell us!" 

Daisuke rubs his chin, his eyes shifting toward the distant horizon. 

Daisuke (muttering): "There’s talk... stories. Old stories. Folks vanish, sometimes for no good reason. Might be tied to things older than this town—things best left alone." 

Shin frowns, sensing there’s more to Daisuke’s words. 

Shin (pressing): "What are you saying? Are you telling us there’s something else at play here?" 

Daisuke looks back at them, his gaze hardened by years of survival. 

Daisuke: "This island has secrets, boy. Dark ones. And those who dig too deep... well, sometimes they don’t come back." 

Emi’s hands clench into fists, her voice trembling with determination. 

Emi (resolute): "I don’t care about the stories. The Satos are in danger. We must find them!" 

Daisuke watches her, the fire in her eyes unmistakable. After a moment, he sighs. 

Daisuke: "If you’re hell-bent on going after them, you’ll need more than courage. Follow me—I know where we might start." 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player Choice: How do Shin and Emi respond to Daisuke’s warning? 

**1. Trust Daisuke’s knowledge and follow him.** 

Shin exchanges a look with Emi, then nods at Daisuke. 

Shin: "Alright, we’ll follow you. Lead the way." 

Outcome: 
Daisuke leads them through the woods toward an old, abandoned path he claims holds the key to the mystery. The atmosphere grows more tense and foreboding, as they get closer to uncovering the island’s dark secrets. This path further explores the story's supernatural elements. 

**2. Question Daisuke’s motives and decide to investigate the Sato house alone.**

Shin narrows his eyes at Daisuke, unsure of whether to trust him. 

Shin: "We’ll handle this ourselves. Thanks for the warning, but we’re checking the Sato house first." 

Outcome: 
Shin and Emi proceed to the Sato house without Daisuke. Upon arriving, they find the house in a state of disarray—furniture overturned, strange symbols scrawled on the walls. The mystery deepens, and they’ll later realize they should have listened to Daisuke’s warning. 

**3. Convince Daisuke to tell them everything he knows before following him.** 

Shin steps forward, his voice firm. 

Shin: "We’re not going anywhere until you tell us exactly what you know, Daisuke. No more cryptic warnings." 

Outcome: 
Daisuke sighs, seeing their determination. 

Daisuke: "Alright, fine. There’s an old legend about this island. Those who disappear are said to have been taken by something... not of this world. I’ve seen strange things, but I’ve never been able to prove it." 

(With this new information, Shin and Emi follow Daisuke with more caution, aware that they may be dealing with something far more dangerous than they anticipated.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEAR THE TOWN ARCHIVES - NIGHT 

Shin and Emi stand outside the dimly lit town archives, their faces etched with worry. The quiet of the night is oppressive, the air thick with tension. 

Shin (glancing around): "The archives should have records of the island’s history. If what Daisuke said is true, we might find something about these... Shadows." 

Emi pulls her jacket tighter around her, her hands trembling slightly. 

Emi (nervously): "I just want to know what happened to the Satos. But what if we find something we can’t handle?" 

Shin places a hand on her shoulder, trying to reassure her. 

Shin (gently): "We’ll deal with it together. We must. Nami would’ve done the same for us." 

Emi nods, though fear still flickers in her eyes. They approach the entrance of the archive building. The large wooden door creaks open with a groan, revealing dark hallways lined with shelves of old books and documents. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Player Choice: What should Shin and Emi do next? 

**1. Search the Archive for Historical Records about the Island.** 

Shin and Emi enter the archives, the smell of dust and old paper filling the air. They move cautiously through the rows of shelves, their eyes scanning for anything that might hint at the island’s dark past. 

Emi (whispering, while pulling a book from the shelf): "Here’s something about ancient rituals... It talks about the island’s settlers." 

Shin (flipping through another document): "I found something too. It mentions disappearances in the past, similar to what’s happening now." 

Outcome: 
They discover an old journal detailing rituals meant to ward off the Shadows, but it’s incomplete. The journal mentions a hidden location in the forest where the full ritual can be found. 

**2. Investigating the Symbol Daisuke Mentioned.**

Shin focuses on the strange symbols Daisuke hinted at, looking through old maps and drawings scattered across the archive’s shelves. 

Shin (pointing to a page in a dusty tome): "Look at this, Emi. This symbol—it’s like the one we saw near the Sato house." 

Emi (leaning closer): "What does it mean?" 

Shin (thoughtful): "It’s part of a warding ritual." We need to figure out where these symbols are placed around the island." 

Outcome: 
They uncover a map with marked locations across the island where protective symbols were once placed. However, some of the markings have faded, leading to a potential mystery regarding where the remaining symbols are. 

**3. Confront the Shadows Directly.** 

Emi grabs Shin’s arm, her voice full of resolve. 

Emi: "I can’t just sit here, Shin. If the Shadows are taking people, we have to confront them—before more disappear." 

Shin (hesitant): "We don’t know enough about them yet. What if it’s a trap?" 

Emi (firm): "I don’t care. We need to stop this now." 

Outcome: 
Shin and Emi leave the archives, heading toward the last place the Sato family was seen. They enter a dangerous situation, encountering strange figures that may or may not be human. This choice leads to a more action-driven path where they must avoid or fight off the Shadows. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ARCHIVE BASEMENT - NIGHT 

If Shin and Emi choose to continue searching the archives, they stumble across a locked basement door. The air around it feels heavier, as if something is waiting beneath. 

Shin (curious): "There’s something down here. Should we check it out?" 

Emi (hesitant): "I don’t know, Shin. This place feels... wrong." 

The door creaks open, revealing a set of stone stairs leading into darkness. 

Player Choice: Should they enter the basement? 

**1. Enter the basement to uncover the truth.**

Shin leads the way down, flashlight in hand, illuminating old texts and carvings on the walls. 

Shin: "This looks ancient. These carvings... they might be about the Shadows." 

Outcome: 
At the bottom of the stairs, they find an old chest filled with forgotten relics and a scroll detailing a ritual to banish the Shadows. But as they read, the air around them grows colder, and they realize they aren’t alone. 

**2. Decide to stay upstairs and continue searching the main archive.**

Emi pulls Shin back from the stairs, her fear overtaking her curiosity. 

Emi: "No, Shin. Let’s not go down there. We should stick to what we know." 

Outcome: 
They return to searching the shelves and documents, eventually finding clues about the Shadows’ weaknesses, but at the cost of missing the potentially more powerful information below. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ARCHIVE ENCOUNTER - NIGHT 

When they enter the basement, as they finish reading the scroll, a strange sound echoes from the shadows. Shin raises his flashlight, revealing a figure standing in the corner of the room—identical to Emi. 

Shin (startled): "Emi...?" 

The real Emi stands beside him, trembling. The unknown girl steps forward, her eyes cold and hollow. 

Emi (terrified): "Shin... that’s... that’s not me!" 

Player Choice: How does Shin react to the unknown girl? 

**1. Attempt to confront the unknown girl.**

Shin steps forward, ready to defend Emi. 

Shin: "Stay back! You’re not her!" 

Outcome: 
The unknown girl moves swiftly, its form shifting and twisting into an unrecognizable shadow. This triggers a fight or flight sequence where they must escape the basement or face the shadow’s wrath. 

**2. Try to flee the basement with Emi.**

Shin grabs Emi’s hand and runs for the stairs. 

Shin: "We need to get out of here!" 

Outcome: 
They manage to escape the basement, but the unknown girl continues to pursue them through the dark streets of the town, setting up a tense chase sequence where they must outsmart the shadow to survive. 

**3. Try to speak to the unknown girl and learn its motives.** 

Shin hesitates, trying to communicate with the entity. 

Shin: "Why are you doing this? What do you want?" 

Outcome: 
The unknown girl stops, its voice cold and eerie. 

Unknown Girl: "To replace. To survive." 

(This opens a path where Shin and Emi attempt to learn more about the Shadows’ true purpose, giving players more insight into the mystery but putting them at greater risk.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOREST - NIGHT 

The forest is filled with gunfire. Shin is paralyzed, his heart pounding as the lifeless bodies of Emi and the mysterious woman lies on the cold ground. The unknown girl, dressed in Emi's school uniform, stands emotionless, holding the smoking gun. 

Player Choice: How does Shin react to the unknown girl? 

**1. Try to reason with her.** 

Shin, shaking with fear and despair, raises his hands in surrender, his voice cracking. 

Shin (desperately): "Please... I don’t understand. Why are you doing this? Just let me go... We don’t have to continue this." 

Unknown Girl (coldly): "You’ll never understand. You were too slow to save her... You’re too slow to save anyone." 

Outcome: 
The girl gives him a long, emotionless look before lowering the gun. She disappears into the shadows, leaving Shin in the clearing, alone with the horror of what just happened. This leads to a path where Shin must continue alone, haunted by guilt and confusion. 

**2. Attack the unknown girl in a fit of rage.** 

Shin, blinded by rage and grief, suddenly charges at the unknown girl. 

Shin (screaming): "You killed her! You killed Emi!" 

Unknown Girl (amused): "So predictable." 

Shin lunges for the gun, but the girl moves swiftly, kicking him in the stomach, sending him crashing to the ground. 

Outcome: 
Shin’s attempt fails, and the girl points the gun at him. However, in a moment of twisted satisfaction, she chooses not to kill him immediately, instead taunting him. Shin’s violent approach puts him in a more dangerous situation, where he must now either escape or outwit the unknown girl. 

**3. Run and escape into the forest.** 

Overwhelmed by terror, Shin turns and bolts into the dark forest, his breaths ragged, branches scratching his face as he tries to put distance between him and the unknown girl. 

Shin (thinking frantically): "I have to get out of here... I must survive!" 

Unknown Girl (calling after him): "Run all you want; you can’t escape what’s coming." 

Outcome: 
Shin manages to flee deeper into the forest, but now he’s lost, surrounded by the oppressive darkness. This leads to a survival sequence where Shin must navigate the forest while the unknown girl potentially pursues him. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Unknown Girl’s Monologue (after any choice) 

No matter Shin’s choice, the unknown girl’s cold, empty voice continues to haunt him. 

Unknown Girl: 

"You see, it doesn’t matter how fast or slow you are. What’s coming can’t be stopped." 

"You think you can save anyone? You’re too weak. You failed Emi, and now you’ll fail everyone else." 

"The island is cursed, Shin. You, Emi, the Sato family—you’re all just pawns in a game much older than you. The Shadows are already here. And they’re coming for you." 

Player Choice: How does Shin respond internally? 

**1. Blame yourself for everything.** 

Shin feels a crushing weight on his chest, guilt gnawing at his soul. His knees buckle as he collapses, sobbing. 

Shin (broken): "It’s my fault... I could’ve saved her... Why didn’t I act sooner?!" 

Outcome: 
This leads to a deep internal struggle for Shin, where his guilt begins to affect his decisions moving forward. He might hesitate in future moments, making choices harder as he battles with his own mind. 

**2. Channel your grief into anger.**

Shin grits his teeth, his hands curling into fists as he suppresses his tears. 

Shin (gritting his teeth): "No more. I won’t let anyone else die. I’m going to stop this, no matter what it takes." 

Outcome: 
Shin’s rage becomes a driving force. This choice opens a more aggressive path where Shin becomes determined to fight back against the Shadows and the unknown forces that are tormenting the island. 

**3. Refuse to give up hope.**

Despite the overwhelming fear and sorrow, Shin forces himself to stand, a faint glimmer of hope flickering in his heart. 

Shin (softly): "I... I won’t let this break me. I’m going to figure this out. I’ll save the others. I’ll find a way." 

Outcome: 
This leads Shin down a path where he actively seeks out allies and information, focusing on uncovering the truth about the Shadows and how to stop them. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mysterious Revelation 

After the confrontation, Shin stumbles across something left behind by the unknown girl—an old, weathered photograph. In it, Emi stands next to a woman who looks just like the mysterious attacker. The caption on the back reads: 

“The twins: Emi and Arisa.” 

Shin (whispering in disbelief): "Twins...? But Emi never mentioned a sister..." 

Player Choice: What will Shin do next? 

**1. Investigate the connection between Emi and the unknown girl.**

Shin decides to dig deeper into Emi’s past, hoping to uncover the truth about her and this mysterious twin, Arisa. 

Outcome: 
This opens a mystery-focused path where Shin searches for clues about the unknown girl’s identity and how she’s tied to the island’s curse. 

**2. Continue the hunt for the Shadows.** 

Shin, with newfound resolve, decides to focus on the immediate threat of the Shadows and finding the ritual that could stop them. 

Outcome: 
This leads Shin on a path of survival and action as he works to confront the Shadows head-on. 

**3. Seek out Daisuke for guidance.** 

Shin realizes he needs help and seeks out Daisuke, hoping the old hunter has 	more information about the island’s dark history. 

Outcome: 
Daisuke shares crucial information, leading Shin to make critical decisions on how to approach the Shadows and the truth behind the island’s curse. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
