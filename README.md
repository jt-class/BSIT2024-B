## First Chapter
Shin Tachibana is a high school student who left Sado Island years ago, hoping for the city's excitement, bright lights, and endless possibilities. But when he received news of Nami's death, something pulled him back. He couldn’t understand it—a sense of duty, maybe—or the gnawing guilt that he had left behind those he cared about most. Nami  is a high school student who has been his best friend, the girl who dared him to explore the darkest caves, who laughed with him under the summer stars, and who has been there for him when no one else was.
Shin woke up on a boat, where his eyes wandered around, and he checked his phone. He saw his childhood friend Nami on the boat. Nami’s dressed in a plain white summer dress. 

"Hey! What are you doing here?" Shin shouted.

"Hey Shin, close your eyes for a sec," Nami said.

"Wha, what are you doing?" His eyes became blurry.

"There you go," Nami said while taking her hand off her eyes.

"What's this?" Shin questioned.

"It's a gift," Nami said, and he suddenly asked about his past. "How are you? How many years has it been since you've been home?" she asked.

"Uhhh, I guess it's been 3 years," said Shin.

"Heeh?!" "You didn't even come back in the new year either," Nami said with a sad tone.

"Uhh, I'm sorry," was Shin's response.

"Anyways, give my regards when you come home, and don't forget to find me," Nami smiled after speaking.

"Huh, I don't get it," Shin says, confused.

"Also, please protect Emi," and she disappears.

Shin is shocked at why he's falling and shouting Nami's name. After that, Shin woke up while shouting Nami's name. The mysterious girl next to him was shocked to hear his voice. 

After that, the ship arrived on Sado Island. When they got off the ship, Emi saw Shin wearing a white T-shirt, blue jeans, and running shoes. Emi was excited to approach him. She was so excited that she ran to hug Shin; she did not realize that there was a car coming towards her. Luckily, the driver saw her immediately to avoid hitting her. 

“Whew, that was close, huh? ”Emi said.

“Hey, Emi, are you okay? Has anything hurt? ”Shin asks and stares at Emi’s blue uniform.

Emi is Nami's little sister; currently, she’s in high school. 

“Oh, no, I’m alright. Thank you for worrying,” she happily said. “However, it’s been a long time since I saw you." They walked all the way to Emi's house to change for the funeral.

They arrived at the funeral.

The small coastal town of Sado, bathed in the warm, golden light of summer, feels eerily quiet, as if holding its breath. Shin can’t shake the feeling that something is off; Nami's death doesn’t seem natural. His mind races as he recalls the mysterious shadows he saw in the days leading up to the tragedy. As he glances at the sorrowful faces around him, a chilling realization dawns: the events of this summer are far from ordinary, and the answers may be more terrifying than he could ever imagine. The island's secrets are beginning to unravel, and Shin is about to find himself caught in a deadly cycle where reality and illusion blur and the past refuses to stay buried. 

After they arrive at the funeral, Shin gives his sympathy to Nami’s family. He feels a deep sense of unease as he observes the mourners. Shin dreamt about his past 10 years ago, when his parents died and the family of Nami’s took him. So he didn’t just think of Nami as just a friend but also his closest family.

“I’m sorry for your loss. Nami was... She was like a sister to me,” Shin softly said to Nami’s father. Ren is Nami and Emi's father.

“Thank you, Shin. She always spoke fondly of you. It’s just... I still can’t believe she’s gone,” Ren said while wiping his tears.

“I've been thinking about what happened. Do you think there was anything unusual before…?”Shin was hesitant but concerned.

“Unusual? No, she was her usual self. But, Shin, why would you ask that? ”Ren was confused.

“I don’t know. It’s just this feeling I have. Like there’s something we’re missing, something we’re not seeing,” Shin said while glancing around and lowering his voice.

“What do you mean, Shin? This was just a tragic accident, right? Ren asks nervously.

“I hope so. But... I can’t shake the feeling that something’s wrong on this island. Something is not natural,” Shin said.

“Shin, what are you saying? ”Ren asks, fear creeping into his voice.

“I don’t know yet, but I’m going to find out. I owe it to Nami to uncover the truth,” Shin said.

After Shin talked to Ren, Ren walked to the other visitors. 

The visitors are talking about Shin.

Unknown person (1): “Is that Shin?”

Unknown person (2): “Ah yes, he must be the one who’s suffering because he lost his best friend.”

Unknown person (1): “But, hey, didn’t you know that they did some autopsy on Nami’s body and the results are that it's just an accident? ”

Unknown person (2): “Aw, that's sad to hear."

Shin looked out the window, then suddenly someone hugged his back, and it was his friend Kenji, who’s in high school too. Kenji is wearing a white polo to show sympathy and black slacks.

Kenji, crying, said, “Shin! It’s been a long time; where have you been?! ” snobbing.

“Kenji! You really dressed up for this, huh? ”Shin glanced at Kenji’s white polo and black slacks.

“Yeah, I figured it’s the least I could do for Nami. She deserves our respect, you know? ”Kenji shrugged, then somberly.

“Yeah, she did. It’s just... hard to wrap my head around all this.” Shin nodded, his expression darkening.

“Are you okay, Shin? You seem off. More than usual.” Kenji noticed Shin’s troubled expression.

“I’m just trying to make sense of everything. Something doesn’t feel right about all this,” Shin sighs, looking back out the window.

“Hey, whatever it is, we’ll figure it out together. Nami was our friend too.” Kenji placed a reassuring hand on Shin’s shoulder.

While Shin and Kenji were talking, suddenly a camera flashed, and they saw Lekra. Shin noticed the flash coming from behind, so he looked and observed if someone was taking a picture. But there’s no one holding a camera. He noticed the little boy staring at him.

In Shin’s mind, “What was that flash? ”.

“Who is that young boy? Shin asks Kenji.

“Ahh, that's Lekra; his family owned the small convenience store on this island, and he’s the child that Nami rescued in the sea.” Kenji whispered in Shin’s ear, “My dad and the police did an autopsy on Nami’s body, and there’s a suspicious mark on her neck.” “Police just decided that the case is an accident because there’s no one around on the water when Nami’s saving the drowning child.”
Shin’s shocked by the news he heard. “What?! Does anyone know about it? ”

Kenji spoke in a low voice, “Only you, the police, my father, and me.” Kenji said, “Let’s talk about it later; I’ll call you.”

The funeral continues their cultural process. Shin’s wearing a plain polo and black slacks. After the ritual, the priest called Shin to assist in lifting the coffin. 

Fuji asks a favor for Shin: “Shin, can you help us lift the coffin? ”

Shin's response was, “Sure, I’m coming over there.”

*They put the coffin in the back of the car that will deliver the body.

Shin and Emi are in the kitchen, and Shin is cooking some ramen for dinner. Emi changed her clothes to her comfy clothes, which are a tank top and a mini short.

Emi excitedly said, “Hmmm, it smells so good. What are you cooking, Shin? ”

“I’m cooking ramen,” he said while cooking.

"Oh, I see,” Emi said. Suddenly, Ren arrived in the living room.

Ren removed his coat and hat while saying, “It smells good. What is that? Is that ramen? ”

“Ahh yes,” Shin proudly said.

“So, you still know how to cook them; I remember that being Nami's favorite food,” Ren sadly said.

"Ahh, yes, I remember. She told me to cook one for her, but I'm too dumb, and I rejected her," said Shin disappointedly. “This is ready; let's eat," she normally said.

Emi takes four plates to show respect to Nami because she wants to give them ramen.

“Ooh, you’re including Nami too,” Ren said. “Ah yes, because I know that she likes this dish specially made by Shin.” 

They eat quietly.

It was 10p.m. at night, and there was a curfew. Haruto, wearing his police uniform, drives his police car through the quiet city streets to patrol. As he passes by a house, he spots Emi standing outside, and she is looking at the 2nd floor of their house while wearing her school uniform.

“Emi? What are you doing out here this late? What are you staring at your own house for? ”Haruto pulled over, rolling down the window of his police car.
Haruto, the police officer, is wearing a washed blue police uniform with a badge and police kit, including a gun. Haruto is in his 20s.
Emi keeps on staring. “.....”

Haruto asks, “Are you okay, Emi? ”

But Emi just looked and smiled at him.

As the day passed and everyone prepared for the next, the routine remained comforting. Shin, as always, assisted in running Ren's restaurant, ensuring everything flowed smoothly. The town seemed peaceful on the surface. Haruto, the only police officer in town, pushed open the door to Ren's restaurant. The familiar chime of the bell announced his arrival. He greeted everyone with a nod and made his way to the counter, his usual serious demeanor softened by the cozy atmosphere of the place.

Shin greeted him with a warm smile, handing him a menu. "The usual, Haruto?" he asked.

"Actually, Shin, I wanted to talk to you about something strange that's been going on around town.” Haruto nodded but hesitated for a moment before speaking. 
When police officer Haruka mentioned that the Sato family had all vanished, the police officer informed Shin and others that the entire family had suddenly disappeared without a trace. It was a crucial turning point that heightened the tension and deepened the mystery on Sado Island.

Emi ran when she heard about the disappearance of the Sato family because she was struck by fear and a sense of urgency. The Sato were close to her, especially Lekra Sato, a young boy. who was friends with Emi. Hearing that the entire family had vanished without a trace was shocking and terrifying, leading Emi to fear the worst. 

After Emi ran off in a panic upon hearing about the Sato family's disappearance, Shin, concerned for her safety, quickly followed her.
"Emi, wait up! What’s going on?" said Shin, panting as he caught up to Emi.

"The Sato family—they’re gone. They’ve disappeared without a trace. I have to find them, Shin. They might be in danger!" Emi's voice trembled.
"We don’t even know what happened yet. It could be too dangerous to go alone," Shin said.

"I don’t care! They’re my friends, and I have to do something. Please, Shin, you have to help me find them!" Emi desperately said.
"Alright, we’ll go together. Just stay close and be careful. Let’s check their house first." Shin nodded, determined.
"Thank you. I just hope we’re not too late," Emi gladly said.

After the tense conversation between Emi and Shin about the disappearance of the Sato family, they are interrupted by the arrival of the old hunter. Daisuke is an elderly hunter who carries a rifle. He wears an orange and white cap, a blue puffy vest, a white t-shirt inside, and blue jeans and pants, with his sniper rifle at his back. He is a local who has lived on the island for many years and is known for his knowledge of the island's history and folklore. His arrival is timely, as he has valuable insight into the mysterious occurrences. Daisuke is portrayed as a grizzled and somewhat enigmatic figure who has experienced strange phenomena on the island before.

"Shin, we need to figure out what’s happening before it’s too late." Emi is still anxious.
"I know, Emi. But where do we even start?" Shin asks.

"I overheard your conversation. It sounds like you’re dealing with something beyond the ordinary." Daisuke enters the scene, his voice gravelly.
"Daisuke! We’re trying to understand what happened to the Sato family. Do you know anything about these disappearances?" Emi was startled.
"More than you might think. The island has its secrets. I’ve seen things that don’t fit any normal explanation. These shadows you’re talking about—they’re not a new phenomenon," Daisuke said.
Upon arriving, Daisuke acknowledges the seriousness of the situation and confirms that the Shadows, doppelgängers, are indeed a real threat. 
"What you’re dealing with isn’t just a coincidence. These shadows are a part of the island’s dark history," said Daisuke's gravelly voice, looking serious.
"You know about them?" Shin asks.

"Yes. The Shadows aren’t new here. They’ve been a problem for generations. They’re doppelgängers that replace people, usually before something bad happens to them," Daisuke said.
"How do they work? Is there a way to stop them?" Emi was worried.
"They mimic people perfectly—looks, memories, everything. But they’re not quite human. The old tales speak of rituals and symbols that might reveal or repel them. The shadows are tied to ancient curses and the island’s past,” Daisuke said.

"So, is there something we can do? Shin asks.
"Be cautious. The shadows are not just dangerous—they’re cunning. They’ll try to deceive you," Daisuke said.
After Daisuke leaves to gather more information about the shadows, Emi and Shin are left to deal with the immediate consequences and their own growing concerns.
"So, what do we do now?" Shin asks.

"Daisuke said we need to look into the island’s history. But I’m scared. Everything feels so overwhelming," Emi said.
"I know. We have to focus on the task at hand. If we find the information Daisuke mentioned, it might give us a way to handle whatever’s happening," Shin said.
"Where should we start?" Emi asks.

"Let’s head to the town archives near the forest. We need to find out more about the island’s past. It might give us some answers," Shin said.
"Alright. Let’s go. I just hope we find something that can help us," Emi said.
As they make their way to the town archives, near the forest, the atmosphere is tense. 
After arriving at the archive house, they saw a silhouette of a girl, and Shin and Emi both looked in that direction, which was in the forest. 
“Let’s follow that girl; it might be someone who can help! ”, Emi said, grabbing Shin’s hand urgently.
Shin just followed Emi around the forest, and they didn’t see the silhouetted girl. 
“Where’s that girl?! ”Emi said. 

“I don’t know either,” Shin responded. 

Within a moment, a loud gunshot echoed into the forest.

“Let’s go and check that.” Emi runs toward the gunshot sound direction, and Shin just follows through. When they arrived, they saw an adult woman injured with slices and a gunshot wound on her left belly. 

“There’s a girl; what are we going to do? She’s bleeding; let's call for help,” Emi’s shaking and panicking said. She runs to call for help.

Shin immediately comes to the mysterious girl and observes what he can do in that situation.

“I’m sorry, I didn’t manage to kill it,” the mysterious girl said. Then a bullet hit the head of the mysterious girl, killing her. 

Shin’s too scared to act, and he looks at the one who killed the girl. The unknown girl is holding Emi in her arms while her head is locked and the gun is pointing into Emi’s head. The unknown girl holding Emi, wearing her school uniform 

"No! Emi!" Shin said, staring in horror.

"You didn’t act fast enough. Now, you see the consequences," the unknown girl coldly said.

"Shin, please," Emi said.

"Stop! Please, just let her go!" Shin said.

“Too late for that,” the unknown girl said.

Gunshot into Emi’s head. Shin was too stunned to speak.

"Emi, no." Shin collapsed, gasping. 

Shin got shot in the head, realizing that, as the scene unfolds, he is left grappling with the devastating consequences of his inaction.

## Second Chapter

Shin woke up on a boat, where his eyes wandered around, and he checked his phone. He saw his childhood friend Nami on the boat. Nami’s dressed in a plain white summer dress. 
"Also, please protect Emi," and she disappears.

Shin is shocked at why he's falling and shouting Nami's name. After that, Shin woke up while shouting Nami's name. The mysterious girl next to him was shocked to hear his voice. 
Emi was excited to approach him. She was so excited that she ran to hug Shin; 

she did not realize that there was a car coming towards her. Luckily, the driver saw her immediately to avoid hitting her. 

Shin was surprised as if that had already happened but he didn't know if it was just a dream or just a coincidence
“Whew, that was close, huh? ”Emi said.

“Hey, Emi, are you okay? Has anything hurt? ”Shin asks and stares at Emi’s blue uniform.

“Oh, no, I’m alright. Thank you for worrying,” she happily said. “However, it’s been a long time since I saw you." They walked all the way to Emi's house to change for the funeral.
They arrived at the funeral.

After they arrive at the funeral, Shin gives his sympathy to Nami’s family. He feels a deep sense of unease as he observes the mourners. Shin dreamt about his past 10 years ago, when his parents died and the family of Nami’s took him. So he didn’t just think of Nami as just a friend but also his closest family.

“I’m sorry for your loss. Nami was... She was like a sister to me,” Shin softly said to Ren.

“Thank you, Shin. She always spoke fondly of you. It’s just... I still can’t believe she’s gone,” Ren said while wiping his tears.

“I've been thinking about what happened. Do you think there was anything unusual before…?”

shin thinks that this really happened, he is confused as if he knows what will happen next, he knows that there are three unknown persons who will talk about him and nami's autopsy.
Shin looked out the window, then suddenly someone hugged his back, and he knew it was  Kenji.

Kenji, crying, said, “Shin! It’s been a long time; where have you been?! ” snobbing.

Shin was restless as if he was looking for someone.

“Are you okay, Shin? You seem off. More than usual.” Kenji noticed Shin’s troubled expression.

“I’m just trying to make sense of everything. Something doesn’t feel right about all this,” Shin sighs, looking back out the window.

While Shin and Kenji were talking, suddenly a camera flashed, and they saw Lekra. Shin noticed the flash coming from behind, so he looked and observed if someone was taking a picture. But there’s no one holding a camera. He noticed the little boy staring at him.

In Shin's mind, "I knew it" 

he was looking for where the flash came from but he couldn't find anyone with a camera and he saw the boy who looked like the one in his dream
"That young boy," Shin said.

"Who? Lekra? his family owned a small convenience store on this island, and he’s the child that Nami rescued in the sea.” Kenji whispered in Shin’s ear, “My dad and the police did an autopsy on Nami’s body, and there’s a suspicious mark on her neck.” “Police just decided that the case is an accident because there’s no one around on the water when Nami’s saving the drowning child.”

The funeral continues their cultural process. Shin’s wearing a plain polo and black slacks. After the ritual, the priest called Shin to assist in lifting the coffin. 

Shin had a hint of what was going on, as if his dream had come true, but he didn't know if it was real or not.

Fuji asks a favor for Shin: “Shin, can you help us lift the coffin? ”

Shin's response was, “Sure, I’m coming over there.”

As time passes by, the things he dreamed about are happening, to the point that he can foresee what will happen next.

Shin and Emi are in the kitchen, and Shin is cooking some ramen for dinner. Emi changed her clothes to her comfy clothes, which are a tank top and a mini short.

Ren arrived in the living room.

Ren removed his coat and hat while saying, “It smells good. What is that? Is that ramen? ”.

“Ahh yes,” Shin proudly said.

“So, you still know how to cook them; I remember that being Nami's favorite food,” Ren sadly said.

"Ahh, yes, I remember. She told me to cook one for her, but I'm too dumb, and I rejected her," said Shin disappointedly. “This is ready; let's eat," he normally said.

Shin takes four plates to show respect to Nami because he wants to give her ramen.

“Ooh, you’re including Nami too,” Emi said. “Ah yes, because I know that she would love this, especially since it's her request before I left the island.” 

While they were eating, Shin could not stop thinking about what Daisuke said about the shadows, "The shadows are part of the island's dark history." "They mimic people perfectly." "Be cautious, they are dangerous.. they will try to deceive you." he said in his mind. He remembered that in his dream, they were killed by the “shadow” in the forest. He thinks that his dream is possible because what happened there seems to align with what he dreamed.

"Shin, are you okay?" Emi asked.

"Uh yes, I'm okay." he replied.

They eat quietly.

Haruto, the only police officer in town, drives his police car through the quiet city streets to patrol. As he passes by a house, he spots Emi standing outside, and she is looking at the 2nd floor of their house while wearing her school uniform.

“Emi? What are you staring at your own house for? ” Haruto pulled over, rolling down the window of his police car.
Emi keeps on staring. “.....”

Haruto asks, “Are you okay, Emi? ”

But Emi just looked and smiled at him.

As the day passed and everyone prepared for the next, the routine remained comforting. Shin, as always, assisted in running Ren's restaurant, ensuring everything flowed smoothly. The town seemed peaceful on the surface.
"Uncle, Can you cook Haruto's usual order?" Shin asked to ren.

"Why? Is Haruto here?" Ren replied.

“No, but I have guts that he will arrive soon.” Shin said

After a few minutes,The familiar chime of the bell announced his arrival. It was Haruto. He greeted everyone with a nod and made his way to the counter.

Before Haruto could even speak, Shin walked towards Haruto at the counter holding Haruto’s usual order.

“Hey Haruto, here’s your usual order.” Shin greeted him with a warm smile while putting his meal on the table.

“Ergh?!” confused haruto. “How? I wasn’t ordering yet!” he added.

“Hehe” Shin replied while scratching the back of his head.

Now, Shin was certain that his dream was real.

"Actually, Shin, I wanted to talk to you about something strange that's been going on around town.” Haruto nodded but hesitated for a moment before speaking.
