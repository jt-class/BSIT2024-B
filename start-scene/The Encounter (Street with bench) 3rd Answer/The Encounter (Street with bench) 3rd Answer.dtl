shin: What was I dreaming about...?

He rubs his temples, but the memory of the dream slips away like mist. 
Despite his efforts, Shin can’t recall the details of the dream.
However, he is left with a lingering sense of dread, as if the dream was trying to warn him of something.
This path leads Shin to focus more on his intuition and feelings.
